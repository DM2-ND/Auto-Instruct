I open the lid of the garbage can and take out the bag . It is not quite full , so I ask everyone in the house if they have any garbage they need to get rid of . I found a couple of misplaced wrappers on the table , which I throw in the bag . It might also be good to check out the refrigerator . Since i found nothing else , I tied up the garbage bag nice and tight so nothing would spill out . I took the lid off that can , and stuffed the bag i was carrying into it , on top of the other one . I put the lid back on , making sure that it was on tightly so no animals would smell it or tear into it .

Question: When did they look around the kitchen Option1: When they saw the garbage bag was not full Option2: After taking out the trash", "target": "When they saw the garbage bag was not full"}
