After that it never had the power to turn over the engine. I did all the research and everything was fine. The regulator was working great. I tried charging the battery again and it fully charged in about 20 min. I live in the tropics and so I don't have to deal with cold temps. This battery was basically worthless and it cost a fortune in shipping and taxes to import it. Watch the vids on Youtube and read other peoples warnings. This is not a good battery.

I have to turn it on and off multiple times for the static to go away. Sometimes the mic is not clear. I use to think that it was because I was away from the phone but even when the phone is in my hand it does not work. I paired it with my iPad and it was worse than using it on the phone. DISAPPOINTED in this purchase. It sounds like something that is short circuiting. I am very annoyed that I made this purchase and lost out on my money. To send it back I will have to pay return shipping. I hope the seller sees this review. Also they sent an email asking me about my purchase when I select the link to complain it\u2019s saying I am log logged in to the account I used to make the purchase smh.

First, the little clasp to keep it on your wrist manages to slip out on it's own. This doesn't happen often, but considering the 2nd main function of a watch is to stay on your wrist, for it to happen at all is pretty bad. And the first function? As in keeping time? Roughly every week to week and a half I have to reset it because it runs fast and gains a minute or more. I need this to be accurate. Accurate time keeping for my job is the only reason I got it. But it can't even manage to do this. If you only need to have a rough idea of the time, you can use this watch, which is a markedly better than just looking at the sun and guessing.
