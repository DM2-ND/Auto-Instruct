I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.  then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this: Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010  Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.  The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.  A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.  Not recommending this at all.

Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.  They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.  So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.  Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!", "target": "My Dog Loves This Food!!"}

I mainly use it for voice overs for YouTube videos, Skype calls, and recording music. It all works great.  When I first received it in the mail, I simply opened it, plugged it in, and it worked. As simple as that. There were no drivers, no installation, and no updates. I just plugged my XLR condenser microphone into the Icicle and the Icicle to the USB on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a USB mic.  This product was WAY lighter than I expected and feels rather cheap. However, that is not really an issue because the product works great. And the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal.  The knob is also useful, as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product, as it is plug and play. Very simple, and it just works.", "target": "Great product"}

I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.

The biscuit is thick and hard, and it is scored down the middle so that owners of mid-sized dogs can break it in half.

I'm sure these will get eaten, and I'm glad they are organic and have good ingredients, but they weren't especially a favorite. I would say my dog likes the Newman chicken biscuits, the heart-shaped ones, better. They are thinner, and possibly easier to chew, altho he doesn't really hesitate about chewing bones.
