My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.  While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.  So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try.", "target": "OK, but not great"}

I understand they're \"kettle chips\" and they're \"fried\" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!", "target": "Delicious!"}

They are a german shepard, pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly.", "target": "Cute idea"}
