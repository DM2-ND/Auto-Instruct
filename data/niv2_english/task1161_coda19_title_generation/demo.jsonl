In the context of the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, Drake and colleagues, in this issue of PLOS Biology, employed an elegant modeling approach to capture the distributions of the number of secondary cases that arise in the community and health care settings in the context of changing population behaviors and increasing hospital capacity. Their findings underscore the role of increasing the rate of safe burials and the fractions of infectious individuals who seek hospitalization together with hospital capacity to achieve epidemic control. However, further modeling efforts of EVD transmission and control in West Africa should utilize the spatial-temporal patterns of spread in the region by incorporating spatial heterogeneity in the transmission process. Detailed datasets are urgently needed to characterize temporal changes in population behaviors, contact networks at different spatial scales, population mobility patterns, adherence to infection control measures in hospital settings, and hospitalization and reporting rates.", "target": "Characterizing the Transmission Dynamics and Control of Ebola Virus Disease"}

The role of cities in human infectious disease is well established, but less is known about how urban landscapes influence wildlife-pathogen interactions. Here, we draw on recent advances in wildlife epidemiology to consider how environmental changes linked with urbanization can alter the biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors. Although urbanization reduces the abundance of many wildlife parasites, transmission can, in some cases, increase among urbanadapted hosts, with effects on rarer wildlife or those living beyond city limits. Continued rapid urbanization, together with risks posed by multi-host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations, emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes.", "target": "Urbanization and the ecology of wildlife diseases"}

To fulfill such a role, crews must be shielded against even incipient degradation of performance capacity. The space environment contains potential hazardsranging from microgravity to infectious microorganisms to chemical toxicants. An extensive literature indicates that incipient disruptions of function may occur at low levels of exposure to toxic agents and degrade performance. Such questions need to be pursued before irreversible decisions are made about space vehicle design.", "target": "TOXICOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF EXTENDED SPACE FLIGHTS"}
