I use them for audiobooks at work during lunch for less than an hour a day so sound quality doesn't matter and I haven't had to charge them, which is the best thing about them. I used them for music once and I thought what I had before was bad, well these are the worst sounding earbuds ever. I didn't realize these had noise canceling. If it does that means you turn the volume up until you hear what you are listening to over the other person in the lunch room that thinks everybody should hear what they listen to.
