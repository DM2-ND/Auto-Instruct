It has pleasant atmosphere with New England locations, overcast days, and spectacular coastal scenery. The story is very suspenseful and deals with the same basic subject matter and emotional conflict as The Bad Seed. It's about a psychopathic child who does whatever he wants from murdering his three year old brother to causing huge car accidents just for sport.Early in the film there is insightful talk about the nature and non curability of intrinsic evil. Then comes a long period of slow and painful discovery. At the end of the movie, the child's mother is forced to make a very difficult choice between goodness and parental instinct.", "target": "Who did the psychopathic child murder?"}
