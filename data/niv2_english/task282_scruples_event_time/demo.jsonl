During that time I'm exposed to all kinds of construction dirt and debris, sheetrock dust, fiberglass insulation, silica from drilling concrete, etc. \n\nSo when I come home after being on my feet all day, I just want to get out my dirty clothes and take a shower so I can sit and relax for a little bit before we do whatever it is we have planned for the evening, if anything. I don't want to track anything into the house that I brought home with/on me. It's not that I don't want to hear what my wife is saying, I just don't want to have to stand there in dirty clothes to do it.\nBefore you ask, yes...I have told her this. But if I tell her regularly (which I sometimes do), she says \" ok, well let me just tell you this first\", or just tells me I'm always crabby when I come home.\nAm I the asshole?", "target": "HISTORICAL"}

Almost all instruments that we use are rented and are given back at the end of the year, so we all make sure to take good care of our instruments so we don\u2019t end up having to pay any damage fees (renting the instruments is already kind of expensive I\u2019ve heard). But since around December, one of The clarinets (call her C) has been using an instrument locker right next to me. I thought nothing of it until I noticed her at the end of class simply throwing her clarinet in her locker. Anyone who knows instruments this could be harmful to it. I\u2019ve asked C about it before, only to have her sass back at me \u201cwhat\u2019s the point anyway\u201d or something along those lines. She\u2019s been simply throwing it in since she started using the locker next to me.\nWIBTA for telling my director about the way C is treating her instrument? I don\u2019t want to sound like a snitch. ", "target": "HYPOTHETICAL"}

My mother just goes on an on saying that she is ugly and has a weird face, for about two or three minutes. I 17M, finally have had enough and tell her that judging a 12 year old kid about their looks is rude and something that should remain unsaid. Now, I will admit, that kid isn\u2019t super good looking, but maybe I just think it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m gay, but she is super nice usually. \n\nWell my mother got all upset at me and every time she said an opinion at lunch she would then say, \u201cOh wait, ntaylor7746 said I\u2019m not allowed to have an opinion.\u201d Am I the asshole for calling her, a grown ass 44 year old woman, put for talking shit about a child?", "target": "HISTORICAL"}
