We have been together for 4.5 years but we were only married for 11 weeks...\n\nIn one conversation about how to split some of our finances and random items I asked to get both the engagement ring and wedding band back (worth ~4K together originally). I worked my ass off selling my soul for a contracted project that I was miserable doing for almost 6 months to be able to make the money to buy them. Considering that she had little regard for our marriage I felt it was reasonable to get them back to try and recoup some of my money. When I did this she looked at me like I was an alien but reluctantly agreed.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking for them back to try and get some of my money back?", "target": "HISTORICAL"}
