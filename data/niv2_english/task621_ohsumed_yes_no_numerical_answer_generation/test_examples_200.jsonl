Two hundred forty-one patients were evaluable for survival and 207 for response. We obtained a 25% objective response rate in the standard-dose arm and 29% in the high-dose arm; this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant improvement in the overall survival or survival of responders with the high-dose regimen. However, toxicity (mainly myelosuppression) was significantly increased in the patients receiving the higher dose of cisplatin. An analysis of prognostic factors showed that disease progression, loss of body weight, performance status, and prior therapy were predictive parameters of survival. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Balloon embolization was performed utilizing two detachable silicone balloons to occlude the mid-basilar artery and the aneurysm. The procedure was carried out with the patient fully awake and alert. One day after the procedure, the patient developed pontine and cerebellar ischemia which completely resolved after 5 days on heparin therapy. A follow-up angiogram performed immediately after the procedure and at 3 months demonstrated complete occlusion of the mid-basilar artery and the aneurysm. The patient was intact neurologically upon discharge 5 days after the embolization procedure and has since resumed his normal activities.

The exact role of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in cerebrovascular disease is still in evolution and remains the subject of debate. The value of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in screening for renovascular hypertension is less controversial, but selection of patients remains a subject for further study. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography has become a standard imaging technique that offers both the inherent safety produced by reduction of the volume of contrast material and the added safety afforded by reduction of both the size of the catheter and the time required to perform complex arterial interventional procedures. With the evolution of more sophisticated computed technology and radiographic equipment, the impact of both intravenous and arterial digital subtraction angiography will become even more dramatic. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Recent studies show that daylength during the prenatal period is perceived by the fetus and that this perception can profoundly influence postnatal reproductive and somatic development. Using the photoperiodic Djungarian hamster, we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone, melatonin, in this prenatal perception of daylength. Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus. Infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights. These results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Traditional internal medicine programs relied almost exclusively on the consultation method and inpatient facilities, offered little formal instruction, used the psychiatrist as the primary teacher, and spent considerably less per resident for mental health training than the other programs. Psychologists and social workers as a group were the primary mental health teachers in family medicine residencies. Traditional internal medicine programs emphasized psychophysiological reactions and simple pharmacotherapy, while primary care internal medicine and family practice programs concentrated on life cycle issues, psychosocial awareness, and simple psychosocial management techniques. None of the three types of residencies focused on complex psychiatric disorders or management techniques.

This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

However, when the operation was reportedly for a ruptured appendix, the relative risk of tubal infertility was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.9) for women who had never been pregnant and 3.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 9.6) for women with one or more previous pregnancies. We conclude that the early diagnosis and treatment of suspected appendicitis in girls and women of reproductive age may reduce the incidence of tubal infertility resulting from the sequelae of a ruptured appendix. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

These procedures are suitable for single or repeated use, with the animal in an unrestrained and conscious state. The relevance to the intended application is demonstrated with respect to artificial liver support by the ability of rat extracorporeal circuits to provide information on the relationship between sorbent properties and liver regeneration as determined by the proliferative response following partial hepatectomy. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Direct visualization of the atherosclerotic plaques and demonstration of their precise location and extent was achieved by magnetic resonance imaging. The size and extent of the aneurysms and the presence of mural thrombus were demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging identified the intimal flap and indicated the proximal extent of thoracic aortic dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging permitted direct visualization of thrombi and aneurysm of the pulmonary arteries. In conclusion, magnetic resonance imaging appears to be a totally noninvasive and reliable technique for demonstration of various pathologic processes involving the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries. Vascular imaging is achieved without the need for contrast media. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

DNA from a series of mouse BWTG3 x rat hepatocyte somatic cell hybrids, each of which has retained a unique complement of rat chromosomes, was analyzed for the presence of rat GH and PRL genomic fragments by Southern blotting. Radiolabeled complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding rat GH and rat PRL were used as molecular probes.

Dobutamine, beginning at a low dose (2.5 micrograms/kg X min) significantly increased cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2), while decreasing mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances; blood gases, pH, and pulmonary shunt were not significantly changed. These effects were seen in postoperative and septic patients, as well as in patients with normal, low, and high control CI. These responses were poor in terminally ill and hypovolemic patients; however, when the latter were given additional fluids, their responses were markedly improved. The hemodynamic effects of dobutamine are well known, but the DO2 and VO2 effects, which suggest improved tissue perfusion, have not been appreciated. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Rotatory fixation without anterior displacement of the atlas (Type I) has been reported in only a few cases in which there has been a prolonged interval between injury and diagnosis. The majority of these cases eventually required cervical fusion for persistent deformity or instability. Two cases are presented in which this diagnosis was made early with the aid of rotated odontoid radiographs, tomography and computerised axial tomography. Treatment by a short period of halter traction achieved reduction and early return of function. The authors conclude that early recognition and treatment of this rare condition may prevent the subsequent deformity and instability for which cervical fusion has been required. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Twenty-nine of these 38 had no associated intracardiac anomaly (Group I), and 9 had complex intracardiac anatomy associated with low pulmonary blood flow (Group II). In Group I the drainage was infracardiac in nine, supracardiac in seven, intracardiac in eight and mixed in five. In both groups, in those with venous obstruction the flow in the individual pulmonary veins and ascending or descending vein was nonphasic, varying only with respiration. Flow in the absence of obstruction was phasic, varying with the cardiac cycle. Distal to a site of obstruction the flow was nonlaminar and of high velocity irrespective of the amount of pulmonary blood flow.

Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Twelve patients underwent bone biopsy immediately prior to and after one year of such treatment. Those with larger quantities of non-mineralized bone matrix (osteoid) experienced a reduction in relative osteoid volume, mean osteoid seam width, and total osteoid surface. Moreover, the use of time-spaced kinetic markers of mineralization (tetracycline) enabled us to demonstrate that CAPD usually decreased the amount of non-mineralized bone matrix by shortening mineralization lag time (that is, the interval from organic matrix deposition to its mineralization). The changes in the histomorphology appeared to occur independently of bone aluminum. These data indicate that CAPD generally enhances the mineralizing capacity of individual osteoblasts and suggests that such therapy is beneficial to the uremic skeleton. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted, grade-III open injury to a pedestrian.

Fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum, the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals (i.e., mismatched sensory input). An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness.

Three patient populations were identified for comparison: patients admitted by private family physicians when residents were not involved in patient care, patients admitted by the same family physicians while they served as attending physicians on the family practice service and allowed residents to participate in the care of their patients, and patients admitted by residents from the patient population at the Family Practice Center. After taking into account differences in case mix, an analysis of laboratory charges, radiology use, frequency of procedures, and use of consultants showed that the three groups were not different. Family practice residents managed their own patients as cost effectively as physicians in private practice, which suggests that experience alone is not necessary to develop methods of cost-efficient care. When these two groups were combined into a teaching unit, with few exceptions this efficiency was maintained. These results imply that the introduction of family practice residents into patient care does not invariably increase expenses to the patient. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

We reasoned that cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL.

To perform the Lachman test correctly, the anterior tibial force must be applied posteromedially on the proximal tibia. This is best achieved by having the leg under examination on the same side of the bed as the examiner, and with slight external tibial rotation. Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs. The importance of tibial rotation must be recognized if the Lachman test is to be used reliably and with maximum sensitivity. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Small amounts of histamine were spontaneously and continuously released during the 4-hour observation in both groups but were twofold greater in patients with CU. In addition, histamine levels were significantly more elevated in sites challenged with compound 48/80 than in unstimulated sites. Patients with CU differed from normal volunteers in that histamine release induced by 48/80 compound was significantly greater at 1 and 2 hours after challenge. The number of mast cells and the histamine content of the skin did not differ in the two groups. These observations could suggest a functional defect at the mast cell level rather than a difference in their numbers. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage; part II, which will be published in the next issue of the Journal, focuses on eye protection. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Nitrogen excretion was found to remain relatively stable or to rise in response to protein intake over a wide range of nonprotein calorie intakes. Urine urea nitrogen excretion was not related to caloric intake, but was correlated (p less than 0.04) with nitrogen intake. In this study protein conservation was not achieved by increasing caloric intake up to and beyond two times the basal energy expenditure in the brain-injured patient. In these patients nitrogen balance could only be achieved by nitrogen intakes in excess of the high protein catabolic rate. These findings argue for a central control mechanism for protein catabolism that is independent of the magnitude of peripheral tissue injury. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

However, its use can induce neuropathy necessitating caution in its administration. It was found in this electrophysiologic study of 13 patients that the data best revealing neuropathy, even when clinical abnormalities were not apparent, were reduction of sensory nerve action potential amplitude on the sural nerve, increase of somatosensory evoked potential latency following sural nerve stimulation, and reduction of sensory action potential amplitude on stimulating the median nerve at the wrist. In two patients, electrophysiologic abnormalities had increased after withdrawal, suggesting a prolonged action of thalidomide. Timely reduction of dosage, after detection of changes indicating the onset of side effects, could reduce the risk of the sometimes rapid emergence of clinical symptoms. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In nine adult cats the adductor branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) of one side was cut and ligated, while the abductor branch was left intact. The whole RLN was then transected lower in the neck and its distal stump anastomosed to the upper branch of the phrenic nerve. Periodical laryngoscopies under ketamine anesthesia assessed that the inspiratory abduction of the paralyzed vocal cord recovered within 45 days to 60 days in all cats. Abduction was caused by reinnervation of the PCA muscle from phrenic motoneurons, as demonstrated by electrophysiological and anatomical (retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase) testings. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, there was a rapid and steady decline in PTH gene transcription rate which fell to a minimum of 10-15% of control at 24 h.

Eleven of the acetabular components migrated cranially and three femoral components migrated distally. This migration was most rapid during the first four months after operation. Our findings support the possibility that mechanical loosening is initiated by thermal injury during polymerisation of the cement; the less frequent migration of the metallic femoral component compared with the polyethylene acetabular component may be because the metal acts as a heat sink. Standard radiographs were inadequate for assessment of early mechanical loosening, whereas RSA could reveal migration within four months of the arthroplasty. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}
