A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Clinical diagnosis can be difficult, however, when patients present with chronic pain and an aneurysm which is not readily palpable. In these patients with confusing abdominal symptoms, CT scan provides a rapid, noninvasive diagnosis. The acute leaking AAA has been documented, but only rarely. This report identifies two patients who ruptured an aortic aneurysm several \"months\" prior to operation--a \"contained chronic\" rupture. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Many patients with suspected bacterial infections are placed on antibiotics before a definite site of infection has been identified. Three hundred twelve leukocyte scans on 271 patients were retrospectively reviewed and classified as positive or negative, and as to whether or not they were being treated with antibiotics at the time the leukocyte scan was performed. The overall sensitivity, considering all 312 studies, was 90%. One hundred sixty-nine patient studies were on patients receiving antibiotics; 143 studies were on patients not on antibiotics. The sensitivity of the leukocyte scan was 88.7% in patients on antibiotic therapy; it was 92.1% in those who were not receiving antibiotics. The differences in sensitivity between the two groups were not significantly different (p less than 0.05). We conclude that antibiotic therapy does not affect the sensitivity of the 111In-labeled leukocyte scan. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}
