Clinically it has been confused with multiple sclerosis, glomus jugulare tumors, meningioma, and chordomas. The cranial nerve palsies frequently observed with the tumors are related to the anatomic locations of the tumors. Thirteen patients with this entity are presented and the eleven other cases in the literature are reviewed. Histologically the tumors are low grade and exhibit myxoid features. The myxoid features must be differentiated from chordoma and chondroid chordoma. The tumor locations preclude surgical excision and conventional radiation therapy can cause unacceptable neurologic sequelae. Proton beam therapy has been effective in short-term results and appears capable of avoiding serious neurologic side effects. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The occurrence of this adverse effect in pregnancy poses an additional dilemma because the use of coumarin derivatives is not acceptable during pregnancy, while other medications may not be as effective. In a pregnant patient treated with mucous sodium heparin for deep vein thrombosis, recurrent heparin-induced thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred. Replacing the heparin with a different brand of the same drug resulted in reversal of the DIC and in clinical improvement. If severe heparin-induced thrombosis occurs in a patient in whom anticoagulation with other drugs is contraindicated, substituting one brand of heparin for another could be of value. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Balloon embolization was performed utilizing two detachable silicone balloons to occlude the mid-basilar artery and the aneurysm. The procedure was carried out with the patient fully awake and alert. One day after the procedure, the patient developed pontine and cerebellar ischemia which completely resolved after 5 days on heparin therapy. A follow-up angiogram performed immediately after the procedure and at 3 months demonstrated complete occlusion of the mid-basilar artery and the aneurysm.

The value of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in screening for renovascular hypertension is less controversial, but selection of patients remains a subject for further study. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography has become a standard imaging technique that offers both the inherent safety produced by reduction of the volume of contrast material and the added safety afforded by reduction of both the size of the catheter and the time required to perform complex arterial interventional procedures.

In vitro studies in order to obtain high adsorption capacity, the synthesized macroporous resin should have an average pore size of about 160 A and with surface area as large as possible. As the crosslinking of the resin increased from 4%-40% the amount of bilirubin adsorbed increased from 0.17 mg/g to 2.0 mg/g. Resins containing strong basic groups have higher adsorption capacities than their corresponding weak base groups. Adsorption mechanism studies showed that both chemical and physical adsorption took place.

Recent studies show that daylength during the prenatal period is perceived by the fetus and that this perception can profoundly influence postnatal reproductive and somatic development. Using the photoperiodic Djungarian hamster, we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone, melatonin, in this prenatal perception of daylength. Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus. Infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights. These results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The locations were identified with respect to the innervation zone and the tendonous portion of the tibialis anterior muscle. Considerable modifications in the median frequency and conduction velocity parameters were noted. The highest values of the median frequency occurred at the region of the innervation zone and tendonous insertion of the muscle, and decreased proportionally with distance from these areas. The rate of change of median frequency was not effected by electrode location. Estimates of conduction velocity were most stable in a region between the distal tendon and the adjacent innervation zone. This region also provided the best linear fit when comparing conduction velocity to median frequency estimates.

We have detected a human serum ACE-inhibitor which affects the ACE level obtained by activity measurements. The effect of the inhibitor can be eliminated by a mere eight-fold dilution of the serum sample with physiologic saline. We recommend that serum ACE be performed with 1:8 dilutions of serum to eliminate the effect of the ACE inhibitor. The inhibitor has a MW above 50,000 daltons, and reversibility of inhibition by dilution appears to be ion dependent. Dialysis of an inhibitor-containing serum sample against saline causes the inhibition to become irreversible, allowing the distinction between alinearity of the assay vs an inhibitor effect when a serum has ACE activity greater than 50 units/ml. The source of the serum ACE-inhibitor remains to be determined. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Monocytes-macrophages and human small cell lung carcinoma cells share several features, including macrophage-specific surface markers and the expression of functional receptors for bombesin-like neuropeptides and growth factors. Because small cell lung carcinoma cells synthesize immunoreactive bombesin, we investigated the possibility that alveolar macrophages also contain bombesin, a plausible hypothesis considering the many reports of neuropeptide production by immune cells and cells of bone marrow origin. Adherent human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as human and guinea pig alveolar macrophages were found to contain bombesin.

The equation is reexpressed in currently accepted terminology, and it is shown that the equation serves well as a basic model of normal walking. Employing this model to analyze VO2/step leads to the elaboration of a three-compartment model of the metabolic cost of walking. This three-compartment model provides a rational estimate of the fraction of walking's metabolic cost that powers the actual walking movement. Doubt is expressed that \"comfortable speed of walking\" is definable in energy terms. It is suggested that the requirements of maintaining balance while walking may determine both the comfortable speed of walking and the curvilinearity of the relationship between ground-speed and freely chosen step frequency of walking. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Three patients had stable disease by NPCP criteria for a mean duration of 6.3 months. Progression of disease was seen in 13 of the 16 patients, eight of whom progressed during therapy. The results of this study suggest that Interferon-beta has limited efficacy in the treatment of advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

We found that mean charges per AIDS hospital admission were $9024, mean charges of patients with AIDS who received all their hospital inpatient and outpatient care at San Francisco General Hospital in 1984 ranged from $7026 to $23,425, and mean lifetime inpatient charges of patients with AIDS who died and who had received all their inpatient care at the hospital were $27,571. These latter charges were considerably lower than previously published estimates of lifetime direct medical care costs of patients with AIDS, and the possible reasons for the differences include much lower lifetime use of hospital services and somewhat lower cost per hospital day. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The subjects were requested to draw on a graphic tablet triangles and squares of different size and shape. The patients produced a larger number of EMG burst compared with controls. The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Involvement of the choroid plexus and leptomeninges was moderate or absent. Intraparenchymatous nodular metastases were not found except in one case in which rare nodular superficial cortical metastases were present. The clinical data were nonspecific except for orthostatic hypotension, in one patient, which was probably due to the infiltration of the floor of the third and fourth ventricles.

Patients were followed for 6 to 264 months (mean, 57 months). Twenty six patients (32%) developed clinically definite or probable multiple sclerosis during the period of follow-up. Actuarial analysis predicted that 42% would develop multiple sclerosis by 7 years. Of those patients who developed multiple sclerosis, 92% had symptoms within 4 years of the first attack of optic neuritis. The highest incidence of multiple sclerosis occurred in the 21-40 year age group. There was an increased risk of MS in patients with HLA-DR2 and HLA-B7 tissue types. The frequency of HLA-DR4 was increased in patients with optic neuritis alone compared to controls and to patients with multiple sclerosis, but further studies are required to confirm this finding. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Limitations of plasma exchange, however, exist. Membrane plasma filtration provides a practical alternative. Solute removal can be made selective by the choice of operating conditions as temperature and the selection of the membrane/module design. The optimal temperature range is a function of the plasma type, solute concentrations and membrane system. Operation at below physiologic temperature (cryofiltration) is particularly suited for the removal of cold aggregative solutes, while operation at near or above physiologic temperature is more suited for the separation of solutes having large size differences at normal physiologic temperature. Membrane filtration is simple and safe to perform, is more selective than plasma exchange, does not require plasma product infusion and is more versatile than selective sorption in its applications. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Traditional internal medicine programs relied almost exclusively on the consultation method and inpatient facilities, offered little formal instruction, used the psychiatrist as the primary teacher, and spent considerably less per resident for mental health training than the other programs. Psychologists and social workers as a group were the primary mental health teachers in family medicine residencies. Traditional internal medicine programs emphasized psychophysiological reactions and simple pharmacotherapy, while primary care internal medicine and family practice programs concentrated on life cycle issues, psychosocial awareness, and simple psychosocial management techniques. None of the three types of residencies focused on complex psychiatric disorders or management techniques. The three specialties differed significantly (F = 13, p = .0001) in the total amount of time on average the resident spent in formal mental health instruction.

Ten adult volunteers were tested on two separate occasions. Their noses were pretreated by oral administration of either combined H1 and H2 histamine antagonists or H1 antagonist and placebo. The nasal airflow resistive response to topical histamine was then determined. Combined histamine antagonism was significantly more effective in reducing the nasal resistive response to topical histamine than H1 antagonist alone (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, ingestion of the oral H1 histamine antagonist, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, alone led to an increase in resistance of the unprovoked nose, whereas combined H1 and H2 antagonism did not lead to a significant change. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The maximal rate of underdiagnosis which results from this diagnostic rule was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus. When symptoms attributed to diabetes (total = 296, mean = 2.6 per patient) were discounted, 256 diagnoses were made. Eighteen additional diagnoses (a 6.7% increase) were appreciated when these excluded symptoms were considered as psychiatrically significant; however, only two of these new diagnoses were given to patients previously without a psychiatric diagnosis. The authors concluded that the DIS is sensitive in its detection of psychiatric illness in diabetes and perhaps other physical illnesses as well. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

This article briefly summarizes 5 years of investigation by our group on hemodynamic support during external cardiac massage. In most studies, long-term canine preparations were used, and implanted transducers allowed precise hemodynamic measurements. Although cardiac output was depressed with all CPR methods, manual chest compressions of high velocity, moderate force, and brief duration at a rate of 120/min seemed to optimize systemic and coronary blood flow. This method was termed high-impulse CPR. High-impulse techniques now have been applied extensively in the clinical setting, and preliminary observations also support their efficacy in man. Based on this experience, it is suggested that the American Heart Association guidelines be changed to recommend a manual chest compression rate of 120/min during closed-chest cardiac massage. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Magnetic resonance imaging identified the intimal flap and indicated the proximal extent of thoracic aortic dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging permitted direct visualization of thrombi and aneurysm of the pulmonary arteries.

She had two episodes in the year following incomplete transphenoidal pituitary tumor resection, but has had none in 2 yr since receiving radiotherapy. The episodes were caused by mineralocorticoid actions of large ACTH-induced increases in cortisol and deoxycorticosterone secretion. A history of episodic edema and hypokalemia, often attributed in women to surreptitious diuretic abuse, requires a careful search for hypercorticism even in the absence of clinical Cushing's syndrome. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

In five of eight term neonates and in all premature infants, a potentially significant limitation of neutrophil production was detected. Unlike the slowly proliferating CFU-GM present in the blood of healthy adult subjects (7% thymidine suicide, range 0% to 32%), the circulating CFU-GM in the premature subjects were proliferating at a near maximal rate (55%, range 40% to 75%, P less than 0.001). Because CFU-GM proliferation is nearly maximal in the baseline, noninfected state, neonates may have restricted ability to increase neutrophil production from CFU-GM during times of increased neutrophil need, such as during bacterial infection. Such inability may predispose neonates to exhaustion of the neutrophil supply during bacterial infection. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In a previous study, more than a third of a group of young mothers volunteering blood samples to establish a creatine kinase (CK) reference range for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) carrier detection regularly participated in aerobic exercise programs. Aerobic exercise programs include eccentric exercises. As eccentric exercise is known to produce a delayed CK peak, this study was carried out to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on serum CK activities. The postexercise serum CK activity peak was monitored in 15 young women (age range 20-23 years) following aerobic exercise classes (45 minutes on 3 consecutive days). Peak values at 24-48 hours following the last class ranged from 90 to 3473 U/liter, or 1.55 to 34.71 times resting values.

The mineralized tissue developed within clusters of giant fat cells in the spaces between the cells. Investigations with light and electron microscopy demonstrated that in these sites there was some differentiation of the fibroblastic cells in an osteogenic direction, shown by changes to more polygonal shapes, and the synthesis of well-banded collagen similar to that found in bone tissue. Differentiation may be due, in part, to increased cell density in a confined space. Growth of the mineralized tissue was observed in the living cultures with a fluorescence microscope. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed that the mineral formed was hydroxyapatite. Initiating sites of mineralization included membranous vesicular bodies, lipid, and products of cellular degeneration. Once initiated, mineralization appeared to spread rapidly into adjacent collagenous and other structures, suggesting the appearance of a mixture of skeletal-type and dystrophic mineralization. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Such behaviour, which is characterized by order-disorder transitions, multi-stable states, and a form of memory called 'hysteresis', has been observed in human stereopsis and has motivated models of stereopsis that incorporate cooperative networks. More recently, cooperative phenomena have also been observed in human visual motion perception.

The FAI is a structured interview followed by a rating process which compares patient status against standard descriptive phrases. Patients are assessed in five areas: mental health, physical health, social resources, economic resources, and activities of daily living (ADL). The validity of the FAI was tested by comparing ratings of patient health obtained by a single investigator using only the instrument with ratings obtained by consensus from an interdisciplinary home care team providing long-term care for the patients studied. An excellent level of agreement (weighted kappas from .583 to .780) was found in all areas studied. A single significant difference in ADL rating with a high correlation coefficient (r = .85) was interpreted as due to a difference between the single rater and the team in the definition of ADL.

First, a structural model with mathematical description of the different diffusion steps was developed. Exact quantification appeared very difficult, resulting in insufficient fit of predicted and measured concentration curves. Moreover, the mathematics turned out simple, since the concentration courses could be described with one exponential power. Therefore, a formal model was developed, assuming linear isotherms and adsorption, proportional to the average concentration in the column. With this model predicted in-vitro inlet and outlet concentrations could be fitted to the measured data accurately. A relation between both models is given under the condition of high intraparticle mass transfer, which is allowed in case of powder adsorbents. It can be concluded that structural models do not yield predictive tools for optimization of device geometry. A formal model with two constants determining device performance enables device optimization with the help of some in-vitro experiments. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

We studied seatbelt use among drivers and front seat passengers involved in motor vehicle accidents for a 3-month period pre-legislation (Phase 1), and a 5-month period post-legislation (Phase 2), to determine if this type of compulsory law, providing civil fines of $50 for violators, changes seatbelt use behavior. The reported use rate among drivers rose from 21% pre-legislation to 47% post-legislation (p less than 0.01). The use rate among front seat passengers rose from 21% to 40% (not significantly different due to the small number of occupants recorded in this position). A highway survey (Phase 3) noted the use rate in New York City and surrounding counties to be 63%, a marked increase from the published pre-legislation value of 16%.

In a prior study, we found that although imipramine had no effect on ejection fraction as measured by first-pass radionuclide angiography, the treatment could not be tolerated by 50% of the patients because of intolerable drug-induced orthostatic hypotension. Nortriptyline hydrochloride is an effective antidepressant that, in depressed patients without heart disease, causes significantly less orthostatic hypotension than imipramine. To see if this advantage could be safely extended to patients with congestive failure, we measured the effect of nortriptyline on ejection fraction and blood pressure in 21 depressed patients with left ventricular impairment. Ejection fraction was unchanged by nortriptyline treatment, and orthostatic hypotension developed in only one (5%) of 21 patients. Nortriptyline emerges as a relatively safe treatment for depression in patients with left ventricular impairment. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

It is most commonly seen as the infant commences ambulation. This so-called physiologic bowing usually spontaneously resolves with growth and the maturity of the lower extremities. In older children, tibia varum may occur, in which there is a local arrest of growth on the posterior medial aspect of the tibia producing a true structural angulation. In certain long-standing metabolic or genetic bone disorders, the effects of weight bearing produce a true bowing of the extremities with changes about the hips, knees, and ankles. The most important aspect in the evaluation of a child with a bowed appearance of the lower extremities is to determine which conditions require aggressive treatment and which ones require simply giving the parents reassurance that the condition will spontaneously regress. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic mechanism involved in the generation of VEP delays is sensitive to stimulus spatial frequency. The study of VEPs before and after the administration of haloperidol confirmed this hypothesis. VEP latency did not correlate with the major clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could not predict the results of chronic dopaminergic therapy. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In Parkinsonian versus normal patients (previously reported) it was observed that: the neutral angle in Parkinson's disease patients was significantly smaller (92 degrees +/- 15 degrees) than in normals (107 degrees +/- 10 degrees), and in Parkinson's disease patients, even with relatively mild symptoms, the upper limb was stiffer than normals in the totally relaxed state with no electromyographic activity present. Our results suggest that changes in the passive mechanical properties of the upper limb affected by Parkinsonian rigidity may have taken place, accounting for the more flexed neutral elbow angle and greater passive stiffness.

Recent data corroborate clinical studies performed in the 1950s and 1960s, suggesting a need to change the present American Heart Association standards for artificial ventilation. These studies show that gastric insufflation followed by regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration are a major hazard of artificial ventilation with an unprotected airway. Present BLS-CPR standards require that ventilation be performed rapidly between external chest compressions or with incremental breaths. These methods of ventilation predispose the victim to gastric insufflation. Alternative methods of ventilation with longer inspiratory time and thus lower flow rate and peak inspiratory pressure are suggested. Additionally, rescue personnel, particularly EMTs and paramedics, should be taught how to apply cricoid pressure to prevent gastric insufflation in victims with an unprotected airway. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Two cases are presented in which this diagnosis was made early with the aid of rotated odontoid radiographs, tomography and computerised axial tomography.

These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction.

The two commonly used incisions, the anterior midline and the medial parapatellar incisions, were compared in order to determine which had the best potential for wound healing. Study of the cleavage lines around the knee demonstrated that the medial parapatellar incision lies parallel to the lines, whilst the anterior midline incision lies perpendicular to them. In addition, the medial parapatellar wound was found to be subjected to significantly less tension during flexion; after arthroplasty it can be expected to heal faster and to be less liable to disruption during early mobilisation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Twelve patients underwent bone biopsy immediately prior to and after one year of such treatment. Those with larger quantities of non-mineralized bone matrix (osteoid) experienced a reduction in relative osteoid volume, mean osteoid seam width, and total osteoid surface. Moreover, the use of time-spaced kinetic markers of mineralization (tetracycline) enabled us to demonstrate that CAPD usually decreased the amount of non-mineralized bone matrix by shortening mineralization lag time (that is, the interval from organic matrix deposition to its mineralization). The changes in the histomorphology appeared to occur independently of bone aluminum. These data indicate that CAPD generally enhances the mineralizing capacity of individual osteoblasts and suggests that such therapy is beneficial to the uremic skeleton. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Each of the eighteen compartment syndromes was documented by measurements of intracompartmental pressure that were obtained by the saline-injection technique, and all were treated by four-compartment fasciotomy. The incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted, grade-III open injury to a pedestrian. The physician must maintain a high index of suspicion to detect a compartment syndrome in the patient who has multiple trauma, as its clinical signs and symptoms may be masked by a closed injury of the head or the need for ventilatory support or prolonged anesthesia for other surgical procedures. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

We prepared a basement membrane matrix from autogenous striated muscle, used it to repair the sciatic nerve in rats, then investigated the results by histology and electrophysiology. When treated grafts were coaxially aligned with the nerve fascicles functional recovery appeared within 30 days, with good growth of axons into the distal nerve. Grafts with myotubes at right angles to the nerve fascicles supported nerve regeneration but at a slower rate. Grafts of coaxially aligned but untreated muscle allowed axon penetration only through naturally degenerated muscle fibres, with minimal axon penetration of the distal nerve. It is concluded that in the rat a treated graft with correctly orientated empty myotubes can facilitate and guide the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury and so lead to recolonisation of the distal stump with functional recovery. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Treatment with rat PRL caused dose-related increases in the percentage of mammary cells that released casein and the average size of casein plaques that formed. The assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity (156 fg rat PRL per assay slide) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of PRL released from individual cells. By combining this \"plaque bioassay\" with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive PRL, it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells. The results of three separate studies revealed major differences among PRL secretors in these potency estimates. Given the existence of PRL variants with different biological and immunological efficacies, these findings suggest that PRL cells differ from one another in the molecular form(s) of hormone released. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

An allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) will only anneal to sequences that match it perfectly, a single mismatch being sufficient to prevent hybridization under appropriate conditions. To improve the sensitivity, specificity and simplicity of this approach, we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to enzymatically amplify a specific segment of the beta-globin or HLA-DQ alpha gene in human genomic DNA before hybridization with ASOs. This in vitro amplification method, which produces a greater than 10(5)-fold increase in the amount of target sequence, permits the analysis of allelic variation with as little as 1 ng of genomic DNA and the use of a simple 'dot blot' for probe hybridization. As a further simplification, PCR amplification has been performed directly on crude cell lysates, eliminating the need for DNA purification. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

None of the patients had clinical evidence of vascular trauma. There were 62 males and ten females, with a mean age of 29.9 years. Gunshot wounds were the most common cause of injury (91.7%) and the thigh was the most common site of injury (47.2%). A normal arteriogram was found in 55 of 72 patients (76.4%). The remaining 17 patients (23.6%) had arteriographic abnormalities that did not warrant surgery. Only one patient was explored (1.4%) for spasm of the popliteal artery. No vascular injury was found at surgery. This study suggests that routine arteriography in proximity injury only may be unnecessary and that these patients could safely be admitted to the hospital for a 24-hour period of observation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The density of IEDs peaked during non-REM stages and was significantly reduced during REM stage. Mean plasma PRL concentrations in epileptic patients, when sampled at 30-min intervals, showed a moderate but significant elevation during non-REM (p less than 0.001) and awake stages (p less than 0.005), but not during REM stage, when compared with 10 nonepileptic control subjects studied in a similar fashion.

The positive and negative predictive values in these patients were 91% and 100%, respectively. Nearly all patients who were in remission had normal enzyme activity. Lymphocyte PBGD determinations also may be of value in determining when to terminate or reinitiate drug treatment. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Three patient populations were identified for comparison: patients admitted by private family physicians when residents were not involved in patient care, patients admitted by the same family physicians while they served as attending physicians on the family practice service and allowed residents to participate in the care of their patients, and patients admitted by residents from the patient population at the Family Practice Center. After taking into account differences in case mix, an analysis of laboratory charges, radiology use, frequency of procedures, and use of consultants showed that the three groups were not different. Family practice residents managed their own patients as cost effectively as physicians in private practice, which suggests that experience alone is not necessary to develop methods of cost-efficient care. When these two groups were combined into a teaching unit, with few exceptions this efficiency was maintained. These results imply that the introduction of family practice residents into patient care does not invariably increase expenses to the patient. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

We reasoned that cyclosporine A (CsA), by opposing these immune responses, could suppress the ENL reaction and restore patients to the quiescent lepromatous state. We tested this hypothesis in vitro by measuring the effect of CsA on M. leprae-triggered suppressor cells. In 24 of 25 patients with ENL, suppressor cell activity was restored by CsA. The target of CsA appeared to be macrophages. These findings are significant in that they provide the first evidence for the potential efficacy of CsA in the treatment of ENL.

The complex anatomy of the parotid space leads to difficulty in localizing these tumors. In addition, physical examination will rarely determine whether a parotid lesion is benign or malignant. High resolution CT scanning with contrast and fine needle aspiration can provide enough preoperative information to enable the surgeon to counsel his patient concerning possible risks and the extent of surgery that may be indicated. We are able to determine tumor location, multiple or bilateral masses, associated adenopathy, and often specific tumor histology. Forty-two parotid aspirates and 26 CT scans were reviewed and correlated with their postoperative pathology specimen. Parotid aspiration cytology was found to be a highly accurate and safe procedure for preoperative determination of parotid pathology. However, the CT scan was specific only in defining the anatomic localization and extent of a parotid mass. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Mean annual inpatient cost increases were $43 and $42 for two Live for Life groups vs $76 for the non-Live for Life group. Live for Life groups also had lower rates of increase in hospital days and admissions. No significant differences were found for outpatient or other health care costs. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The lesion was reduced to 50% residual stenosis using a 1.7 mm laser-heated metallic capped fiber and two pulses of 8 W of argon laser energy, each delivered for 5 seconds. With subsequent balloon angioplasty, the lesion was further decreased to 10% residual stenosis. The entire procedure was well tolerated without chest pain or burning, vessel perforation or spasm, thrombus formation or embolization of debris. The patient was free of pain at 1 month follow-up. This case demonstrates the feasibility of safely performing percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty. Additional studies are indicated to determine the clinical role and potential benefits of coronary laser thermal angioplasty in relation to the established procedures of bypass surgery and conventional balloon angioplasty. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The studies of 26 normal females and 23 normal males were subjected to bilinear interpolative background subtraction and horizontal profile analysis. Significant sexual differences were found in both regional uptake ratios and washout rates. These differences primarily reflected a proportionately decreased anterior and upper septal uptake in females, and faster washout in females. Faster myocardial 201Tl washout rates in females could not be clearly ascribed to either a physiological or artifactual explanation. It is concluded that since important differences exist between males and females in the detected pattern of 201Tl myocardial uptake and washout, sex-specific criteria may enhance the predictive accuracy of exercise-redistribution 201Tl myocardial scintigraphy. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

We analyzed the outcome of 46 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer on whom mechanical ventilators were utilized. Although seven patients were ultimately weaned and survived for at least 24 hours, three of them subsequently died prior to discharge from the hospital. The remaining 39 patients died while using the ventilator. Patient age, tumor cell type, and the etiology of respiratory failure were not significantly different between the weaned and unweaned populations. A difference was noted in the duration of mechanical ventilation: none of the patients who could be weaned required mechanical ventilation for more than six days (range, two to six days). Respiratory failure in the nonsurgical lung cancer patient carries a poor prognosis, and selection of patients for mechanical ventilation should be conservative. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Campylobacter jejuni infection was recognized in all the ill students and caused asymptomatic infections in three others. In total, 22 (88%) of 25 students who consumed raw milk for the first time became infected as compared with none of two who had not consumed raw milk. Among ten persons who chronically consumed raw milk, none was ill, a striking difference from the 76% attack rate among the 25 acutely exposed students. The quantity of raw milk consumed was directly related to the occurrence and severity of illness. Acutely infected students showed significant rises in C jejuni-specific immunoglobulins, whereas the low antibody levels seen in unexposed persons did not rise. In contrast, acute-phase serum samples from persons with chronic exposure to raw milk showed elevated antibody levels to C jejuni. These findings indicate that chronic raw milk consumption is associated with elevated levels of C jejuni-specific serum antibodies and with immunity to symptomatic infection. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways.

Reaching across the bed to examine either leg can create either false positive or false negative Lachman results due to inadvertent tibial rotation (internal tibial rotation decreases translation) and inaccurate comparisons of the injured and normal legs.

A physical examination focused on aspects of mobility was completed on each resident and was intended to characterize the physical limitations in groups studied. In the nursing home environment, use of the wheelchair is viewed by the residents as a self-initiated choice which the residents believed significantly enhanced their sense of well-being.

The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range.

Nitrogen excretion was found to remain relatively stable or to rise in response to protein intake over a wide range of nonprotein calorie intakes. Urine urea nitrogen excretion was not related to caloric intake, but was correlated (p less than 0.04) with nitrogen intake. In this study protein conservation was not achieved by increasing caloric intake up to and beyond two times the basal energy expenditure in the brain-injured patient. In these patients nitrogen balance could only be achieved by nitrogen intakes in excess of the high protein catabolic rate.

Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Three hundred twelve leukocyte scans on 271 patients were retrospectively reviewed and classified as positive or negative, and as to whether or not they were being treated with antibiotics at the time the leukocyte scan was performed. The overall sensitivity, considering all 312 studies, was 90%. One hundred sixty-nine patient studies were on patients receiving antibiotics; 143 studies were on patients not on antibiotics. The sensitivity of the leukocyte scan was 88.7% in patients on antibiotic therapy; it was 92.1% in those who were not receiving antibiotics.

One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Within-subject changes in clearance have been generally reported in patients with acute exacerbations of disease states such as cor pulmonale or heart failure. Apparent random changes in theophylline clearance within the same patient have recently been reported. This report describes a case of suspected changes in the clearance of theophylline in a morbidly obese patient (250 kg) over a two-month period of time. Frequent dosage adjustments were required to maintain theophylline concentrations within the range of 8.2 to 27.3 micrograms/ml. Possible explanations for these changes included hypoxia and medically induced starvation. Daily theophylline doses ranged from 600 to 1600 mg/d. It is concluded that in some individuals, within-subject changes in theophylline clearance can be substantial, thus requiring frequent monitoring of theophylline concentration. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In native PF no significant difference in the incidence of endometrial tissue between patients with (19%) and without (11%) endometriosis (P = 0.6) was observed. Refluxed PF, obtained after uterine irrigation, showed a significantly higher incidence of endometrial tissue in women with endometriosis (76%) as compared to controls (42%) (P = 0.03).

Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

One population is normal; the second population appears to have a deletion of about 10 amino acid residues from the middle of the triple helical domain. The mutation in pro alpha 2(I) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1(I) chains, lowers the melting temperature of type I collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2(I) chain, and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture. On the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families, it appears that the OI type IV phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2(I) that alter the triple helical structure of type I collagen. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

For this study, nitrogen tagged with radioactive 13N was prepared in a linear accelerator. Nine human subjects rebreathed this gas from a closed circuit for 30 min, then completed a 40- to 100-min washout period breathing room air. The isotope 13N was monitored continuously in the subject's knee during the entire period using positron detectors. After correction for isotope decay (half-life = 9.96 min), the concentration in most knees continued to rise for at least 30 min into the washout period. Various causes of this unexpected result are discussed, the most likely of which is an extensive redistribution of gas within avascular knee tissues. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

Residents of various specialties attended a mandatory short course on clinical teaching skills in the middle of their first year of postgraduate medical training. Three types of evaluation data were collected at three times during a two-year period: self-ratings by the residents, questionnaires completed by the residents, and ratings completed by students taught by the residents. Complete data for 18 residents indicated that the residents rated their teaching skills significantly higher after the course (at the end of both the first year and the second year) than before it. At the end of the second year, 94 percent of the residents stated that the course was helpful, 67 percent could recall and explain specific principles of teaching, and 61 percent reported using principles from the course in their teaching. Students' ratings of these 18 residents were too scanty to be interpreted validly. The study suggests that residents of varying specialties can profit from an introductory course on teaching skills and that the effects endure for at least one and a half years. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Investigation aims to determine the level of the injury for each of the nerves, trunks or cords, with particular reference to obtaining firm evidence of any intradural (pre-ganglionic) damage. We report the results of computerised axial tomography of the cervical spine in comparison with conventional myelography and with surgical exploration of the plexus. CT scanning with contrast enhancement greatly improves diagnostic accuracy, particularly at C5 and C6 root levels. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Key elements to the diagnosis included a predominant eosinophilic response of the sinus mucosa, the presence of a characteristic mucoid exudate containing fungal hyphae, peripheral blood eosinophilia, serum precipitins against C lunata, elevated serum total and Curvularia-specific IgE and IgG concentrations, and immediate cutaneous reactivity to C lunata antigen. This report suggests that an exaggerated allergic response should be considered in the pathogenesis of pansinusitis. The presence of fungal hyphae in sinus mucosal specimens should alert the physician to the possibility of this disease. Sinus fungal cultures, as well as thorough immunologic evaluation, of such patients is recommended. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested. It is concluded that Al-DFO complex formed in vivo can be effectively removed across the leaky membrane. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The results showed poor consistency between documented and estimated sex. Of the two variables comprising the index, it appeared that sciatic notch width was a particularly poor discriminator of sex. It is suggested that this may be due to differences in the relationship between sciatic notch form and body size in different ethnic groups. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "No"}

In all of the patients, complete resolution of the lesions was achieved. Due to a superficial coagulating effect, application of the argon laser should be restricted to macular and papular pigmented lesions. In contrast, Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers could be used even for treatment of extensive leukoplakia-like and verrucous lesions. Advantages and disadvantages of these two lasers are discussed. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Despite the persistence of the synostosis, the patient adapted to loss of forearm rotation. No further treatment was necessary. Isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft are slow in healing. Several authors observed that early function may be beneficial. However, excessive activity causing motion at the fracture site may cause subperiosteal hemorrhage and soft tissue trauma and may stimulate exuberant callus formation. Fractures of the ulnar shaft, even undisplaced, need to be immobilized to prevent overuse. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered. Levels of serum IgA, IgD, and IgE were found to be elevated both in OSMF and oral cancer. Immunologic derangements were found to be more pronounced in oral cancer than in OSMF. The enumeration of HARFC along with the estimation of serum levels of IgA, IgD, and IgE indicates that OSMF can be an intermediary stage in the malignant transformation of a normal cell, and that these parameters may serve as markers for the early detection of oral cancer. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to explore regret after sterilization among 268 sterilized women. The subsequent histories of 144 women who did not return for surgery were examined, to determine whether failure to return might have screened, selectively, the women at greatest risk of regret. High levels of subsequent unwanted conception and pregnancy wastage were found in the nonreturn group. Institutional factors were often implicated in failure to return. Variables available at initial presentation are proposed to identify women who risk adverse consequences of postponed sterilization, to facilitate return without increasing regret. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

In three of six patients, subtle abnormalities in follicular development were detected. In the first case poor follicular growth was observed. There was a premature small rise of luteinizing hormone (LH) with subsequent low levels of estradiol (E2) in the late follicular phase and unusual wide LH peak. This was followed by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase. In the second case follicular growth was abrupted by premature LH surge. This surge was triggered by early rise of E2 level while the follicle was still small in size. In the third case luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome was diagnosed, on ultrasound examination. All of the abnormalities were repetitive. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}

Seven patients obtained histologically documented complete remissions ranging from 4 to 105+ months in duration. Median survival is 16.5+ months. Three patients in whom splenomegaly was detected during their staging evaluation underwent splenectomy. These three patients have had unmaintained disease-free survivals of 36+, 100+, and 105+ months. This study indicates that BAM-M is effective therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides and suggests that the therapeutic role of splenectomy should be evaluated further. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "target": "Yes"}
