I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one.", "target": "Positive"}

I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.  The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.  It's an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving.", "target": "Negative"}
