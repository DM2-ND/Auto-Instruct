There seems to have been no thought to features in the photo category by the designers.  There is no setting to allow you to display a full frame.

There is no zoom as on my old Roku either so you can't get to just a part of the photo.  Some of the TV features are nice to have but as other reviews noted, the HDTV standard requires full 5.1 sound.  Let's hope there are some software fixes to this box soon!    (Revision:  The goofy zoom and pan is actually the default \\\\\"Ken Burns Effect\\\\\" and can be turned off.  That does get you the full picture on Landscape photos but not on Portrait.
