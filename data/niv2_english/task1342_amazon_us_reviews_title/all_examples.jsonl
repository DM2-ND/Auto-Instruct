There seems to have been no thought to features in the photo category by the designers.  There is no setting to allow you to display a full frame.

There is no zoom as on my old Roku either so you can't get to just a part of the photo.  Some of the TV features are nice to have but as other reviews noted, the HDTV standard requires full 5.1 sound.  Let's hope there are some software fixes to this box soon!    (Revision:  The goofy zoom and pan is actually the default \\\\\"Ken Burns Effect\\\\\" and can be turned off.  That does get you the full picture on Landscape photos but not on Portrait.  No \\\\\"help\\\\\" and no documentation comes with the box though - so easy to overlook this!  Very user unfriendly!

With the additional cells the battery profile has added about 3/4&#34; to the bottom of my laptop.  This actually works out nicely because it raises the back of the laptop slightly and makes the angle of the keyboard more comfortable (for me) to type on and gives a little more airflow for the fan to ventilate the unit.  The price point for this battery was a significant bonus, as the the HP version (if you can find one) is upwards of $70.

We have two computers using Ethernet connections to the router, a wireless notebook PC, and the Xbox 360 which is connected via an Ethernet cable.  With the WBR-2310, despite hours of screwing around with the configuration, the Xbox live connection would disconnect frequently; so, most of the time we had it connected directly to the modem, thus preventing simultaneous use of the internet on our PC's.<br /><br />The DGL-4300 was a dream (comparatively) to install.

My interest in this device was to evaluate its capability for use within a private high school that serves the bottom socio-economic quartile.   Our goal is to increase the quantity and quality of reading done by students in an environment where we cannot afford up to date textbooks and fiction.    The product met or exceeded every technology requirement without exception.   This product received our highest value, ease of use, design, networking, and durability ratings.   Instead of buying books and placing them on shelves, we are purchasing this portable hand held digital library for students to check-out and use.  (We lack the funding to simply give each student their own unit).    Objections to the device: Old style 20th century vintage English Language Arts (ELA) teachers could not overcome the lack of physically turning pages when reading.  Apparently old style paradigms die hard for the veteran teachers.  Students embraced this digital library with energy and full enthusiasm.  (When inflexible Teachers fail to recognize the abilities of students, you can stop wondering why we have education problems in this country).    This product is superior in every way save one: Color.  For graphics, maps, illustrations, etc. the device needs color display capabilities.", "target": "Utility, Value, Fun"}

My first gripe it that it does NOT fit into the cover for my previous Kindle, despite having been assured that it would do so by Amazon Chat line. It is just a bit larger. The cover cost me $50, so I'm a bit less than impressed! (And yes, ok, I guess I should have checked the specs myself.)<br />I found it too easy to select the incorrect item on the touch screen, and had to use the rear end of a pencil instead of my fingers (and I don't have large fingers), but perhaps this is just a need of practice on my part. I hope things improve.<br />An Addendum after about a month's use: I'm really sorry I bought the 'Touch' Kindle. I much prefer my previous Kindle with the  page turn buttons on the side and the 'four way' selector button; much more positive. I've also been frustrated by the occasional unwanted 'double page turns' of the Touch when 'swiping' the screen.", "target": "Initial impression"}

No difference what so ever. So I resorted to just going wired.     To make your computer N compatible, it will cost you close to $200 for the adapter and this router. So unless you want to spend the money for it, go for it, it will be better but its only limited to whats N mode ready.

It was released in Japan late 2004.  Not sure about the rest of the world.

However, if you have a digital camera that supports high speed transfers, you might want to get the Red Sony High Speed since it supports that high speed transfers.  To my knowledge, only Sony, not Sandisk, makes the high speed transfer version.  However, from what I understand for PSP usage, you do not need the high speed; although, you can use the high speed in a PSP from what I've read.
