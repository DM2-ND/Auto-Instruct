POST : This is a pretty light and funny situation, so don't think anyone in this thread is a bad person, but its technically a moral dilemma so yeah.  Basically, my friend invited me over on a trip to Arizona with his family in June, which I thought was very fun.  He told me all my costs would be covered, and I said I just needed to get my parent's permission.  So I relayed the situation, and they were fine with me going, but they adamantly refused to let his family pay for anything.  (Btw, for context, both of our families have the adequate resources to pay, so no one would be struggling).  HIS parents then adamantly refused to let my parents pay, and it was a back and forth till we settled on them paying for the tour and my family paying for the flight.

The bio says stuff about her wanting a sugar daddy and how she's selling herself as \"texting partner\" or a \"role-playing partner\" and how she's selling foot pics and hand. All of her posts are in the same vein as her bio, with tags like #fetish or #dirtyroleplay. Again, she's 17.
