He called his dad and his dad said he can't take him back home, so my friend had told me he is planning to stay for the night. This is time in my area is actually considered the weekend so I had plans for the next day (mostly regarding working on my business), so I told my friend I can't this time let him stay, and I asked my dad if he was able to take him, and he agreed, so he left with my friend.\n\nAm I the asshole for not letting my friend stay at my place?", "target": "yes"}

POST : TL; DR at bottom.  \n\n\nA friend of mine started a fund campaign to raise money for her dog's surgery. It was legit, not a scam. Apparently there was a terribly painful injury to the dog that was getting worse and they wanted to raise $2,000 for the surgery ASAP. There weren't a ton of details about what the injury was or what the surgery was for exactly, but whatever, I gave a little bit.  \n\n\nHere's the AITA part: I found out through a third party that the dog didn't end up making it to surgery and had to be put down. AITA for thinking they should give the money back they raised? I didn't say anything and I'm not going to bug a grieving family over 25 bucks, but I just found it tacky they just kept the money meant for something specific that didn't happen.   \n\n\nTL; DR: Friend started fund campaign for their dog's surgery, which I gave to, but dog had to be put down before surgery.

POST : One of my coworkers was the longest serving person other than myself at my family's restaurant and has looged the most hours by far out of any employee at the place. That was until they quit today. My father had both become reliant on and been taking advantage of the fact that they were willing to work a lot no matter what by working them a lot and not paying them on time (under the table so he can get away with it easier). This went on to the point they had racked up a thousand dollars in back pay. They and many of my other coworkers had expressed their frustration with my father not paying on time and  during one of these conversations I mentioned to them that my father doesn't think they'd quit no matter what he did. Well they used this as their reason to quit and exposed me by telling him. Now I'm being forced to fill in for their duties until they're replaced as they were the closing cleaner and did most of our baking. So AITA?", "target": "yes"}

POST : I get that normally breaking up over e-mail is bad, but I need to explain the situation.\n\nMy wife of 6 years and I recently moved out onto some land, that is a couple hours away from our friends. I've been having some doubts about our relationship and I think I'm in love with my Ex. My wife is away (back in town) for the weekend, staying with her best friends. I'm drunk and broken up over it, but I wonder if I should tell her while she's there and has the support of her friends, instead of at our home where she would be alone.\n\nI feel like she deserves better than me. We are in an open relationship and she does not care that I have been spending time with and sexually involved with my ex, but I don't think she has any idea that I am falling in love with another woman.\n\nWIBTA if I broke up with her over e-mail while she's with her friends, instead of waiting until she's back here with me?", "target": "yes"}

For example, if you're too tired to play defense, then go home. Don't sit there and not guard your man, every loss leads to a minimum 1-2 game wait. If you can't dribble well, stop trying to drive into 3 defenders so you can get stripped every time. If your man just hit multiple threes, stop sagging off during the game winning shot.
