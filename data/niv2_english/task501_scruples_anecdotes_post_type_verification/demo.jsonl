She broke up with me after distancing herself and pushing me away. She told me she had to work on herself and couldn\u2019t do so with us together. I was heartbroken, sobbing, couldn\u2019t eat or sleep for days. Finally after about a week I jokingly downloaded tinder, after finding out she \u201cjokingly\u201d made one the day we broke up, just to feel validation after feeling like shit for weeks. I ended up getting quite a few matches and talking to a few other girls. My ex finds out and started telling our friends she had a breakdown over finding me on tinder. Now she unfollowed me on all social medias and is trying to get our friends to turn on me- even though SHE broke up with ME. Am i the asshole here for trying to have fun and move on?
