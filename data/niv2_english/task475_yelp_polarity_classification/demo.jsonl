They offer admittedly only a mild amount of entertainment, but it does offer a cheap test of your commitment to caring for a very undemanding living being.  You may even grow to love fish and their simple nature that never tires of going up and down the same old stretch of water.\\n\\nHaving decided to get a fish you simply must come here as it can't be matched by anything you get elsewhere.  The range is simply unbelievable and despite this the prices are very good.  This is the one stop fish shop.", "target": "POSITIVE"}

We placed our order online and quoted 45-1 hour, after an hour 15 we called and were told the driver just left.... 45 minutes later (as we were calling to cancel) the driver arrived. \\nThe food was awful. Sickening, actually. We threw out most of it, only ate some bc we were so hungry. \\nWish I had checked reviews prior to ordering....", "target": "NEGATIVE"}

So if you like quality food,and not really stop by the price.. this is a good place to go.", "target": "POSITIVE"}
