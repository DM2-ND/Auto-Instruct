The Starbucks is like any other Starbucks but a few dollars more than you may be used to paying.  You are better off going to one of the casino's cafes or pastry/chocolate stands to get breakfast.

Average time speaking with \\\"\"doctor\\\"\" or nurse practitioner  10 minutes.  \\n\\n30 minutes of waiting and 10 minutes of service.  The final straw was being charged 84  dollars to wait 30 minutes (the average) and then 2 minutes to pick up a prescription refill.  \\n\\nWhile many others may have had a better experience, I can not stand for the services and treatment received.

Now I know why the consummate caring Dr. McGhee left the Freemont group.  \\n\\nTonight at 8pm, I called and spoke with the after hours service. I asked Maria that the Dr. on call to please give me a call as my son was continuing with the symptoms that he had earlier that day when we were in the office just 4 hour earlier. \\n\\nMaria spoke to Dr. Schnitzler who was on call that evening. Maria spoke with Dr. Schnitzler, who refused to speak with me or call me!  That is a serious issue with me and one that I will be pursuing with the state board.  I will be leaving this practice as the culture and caring quotient has certainly changed.  This is the profession that he chose, I really don't care if my son had a sneeze or the 104 temperature that he had, he should speak with the patient.", "target": "NEGATIVE"}

With this in mind, we had a radio station that was doing a remote from our location plug his truck 3 times, on the air and we advertised on our website and Facebook that it would be there. At 9pm, just when we were beginning to get busy, the owner of the truck said \\\"\"We're not making much money. This might not be worth it for us.\\\"\" I explained that the busiest time we have is between 9pm and 12 midnight. 10 minutes later I looked over and the truck was shutting down. I begged and pleaded for him to stay as agreed, since we advertised food and he said, \\\"\"Sorry. Not making enough money\\\"\", and drove off. For the rest of the night I fielded complaints from disgruntled customers complaining that we had no food. Do not take this company at their word. They are only out for themselves, period.", "target": "NEGATIVE"}

My group ate heartily and we all agreed this is one of the best buffets to go to while in Vegas.

The drinks are expensive, like most very nightlife spots; however, Gold Lounge is not nice enough to charge such prices.  \\n\\nIf you want to hang out in a tiny longue with bad music and a lot of old people who are trying way to hard to stay young, then Gold Lounge is the place for you.

They have great flavors here. I think people who order the usual stuff like chicken chow mein etc etc think it's bland because that's a kinda boring dish. Everyone has chicken chow mein! Try something different. Yeah the owner is hard to understand, but he knows the basics and it's not too hard to order. If you ask to make it spicy, it adds extra flavor. So sad that they're hardly ever busy, but they're tucked away hidden behind the liquor store and rally's. They really need a better location, or something like that. I just barely realized they were here recently. I talked to him today and he said this might be his last year. Sad face :( :( he's been there 16 years he said. \\n\\nMaybe we can help him stay put by frequenting his restaurant more often!\\n\\nGo! Eat! Explore the flavors of Thailand!", "target": "POSITIVE"}

Now dinner is 4-9/10 and is doubled the price per say, and includes all of the same items BESIDES an addition to cold crab legs and shrimp. I personally like crab legs hot, so I didn't enjoy. We ironically got there at 3:30pm, obtained lunch price and then experienced dinner for no extra charge.

The crunchy noodles compliment the soup nicely. I've been a loyal fan of this place since the '80's and I can tell you it is CONSISTENTLY good. All of the entrees are wonderfully flavorful and served hot from the wok. They will gladly spice up or down per your request any dish like the kung pow chicken.

After having the most epic bachelorette celebration the night before, it was necessary for us to refuel for the trip back to Cali. Since we were staying at the Signature and couldn't bear to mission it anywhere else for brunch, we decided to go to the buffet at MGM. It was awesome that were no lines and we were immediately seated. \\nThough I was definitely hurting from the 6 bottles of drank that we killed the night before, I managed to appreciate the quality of the brunch selections. I loved how I was able to satisfy my hangoverness with different plates of breakfast and lunch items. Overall, if you're in the MGM and looking for a variety of things to eat then definitely check this buffet out.", "target": "POSITIVE"}

I've come here every day, the spray bottles to wipe the machines and weights have been missing twice, this is unacceptable. I don't pay a fee to come use a machine covered in someone else's sweat. I can understand if a bottle needs to be refilled but to have NO way to clean the machines is unprofessional. I know I would never recommend this gym to anyone else.  I cannot wait until I move...I hope the Walnut Creek location is better than this Tempe one!! They got a star for being open and another for air conditioning.

Whether eating indoors or on the outdoor patio facing the mountains, it's always a very comfortable atmosphere. Ambiance alone makes this a great place.\\n\\nI am delighted to see a new item on their menu that is vegetarian -- it's a grilled veggie wrap and since i'm vegan, i just ordered it without the cheese, and unlike most vegetarian items that are tasteless without cheese, this sandwich was perfect. Very tasty non-dairy dressing. Two thumbs up to the Verrado Grille for adding this healthy and cruelty-free option to their menu. Now when my meat-eater friends and family dine there, I no longer have to decline. :) \\n\\nAlso, the chocolate cake I had there was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had anywhere! \\n\\nDefinitely worth the drive if you are outside of Verrado.", "target": "POSITIVE"}
