When I arrived, I was told it was a 20 min wait for takeout.  Seriously???  Just as I was told this, I saw others walk in and were immediately seated.  I was really hungry so I decided to eat there hoping my food would get to my belly quicker.  I sat at the bar and ordered my meal.  They were definitely understaffed.  I watched as one very dramatic patron complained about how long it was taking to get her food. \\n\\nThe food took a really long time, but  I was satiated with my appetizer of veggie spring rolls.  I had never had cold spring rolls but I enjoyed them.  The Szechwan Style Bean Curd was flavorful and the portion was generous. Unfortunately the experience wasn't enough to make me wanna run back and eat here.\\n\\nOh...and If you wrap my spring rolls up to go, wouldn't you think to wrap up the tasty peanut sauce that came with it??? Maybe it's just me...", "target": "NEGATIVE"}

The food here is tasteful, however they are beyond stingy with their mimosas (and when you're paying for unlimited, they better taste up to my standards). The overall experience at the buffet was good, however there were a few issues. The host at the cashier stand was not very friendly and the server was asked by the hostess to take two groups to two different tables, he mixed up the tickets numbers and gave the party of 2 that was before us the table we were supposed to have. When he realized his mistake, we had to go back to the front of the wait line and wait another 10min for a table.", "target": "POSITIVE"}

It's kinda hidden---I've walked by it a million times but never stopped there.  \\n\\nI've had three meals there---a chicken sandwich (delicious) and Amy's salad (twice).  The first time the salad was amazing.  The second time, the apple they shred over the salad was brown and soggy.  It was a little gross, to say the least.  I pushed it to the side and continued on my way.  I've also had the pretzel appetizer, which is very good.  My friend raves about the grilled cheese.\\n\\nExpect to spend about $10-$15.  I haven't gotten around to trying any of the beers, but they have an impressive selection.  Check this place out, especially if you work downtown.
