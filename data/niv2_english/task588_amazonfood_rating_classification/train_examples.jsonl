For christmas I looked every where for this coffee & found what I thought was a great value on Amazon. When I bought it (12/21/11) there was \"No Image Available\", should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely it's \"Roger's Family Company\" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if you're in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company, don't buy this coffee. But on the upside, since I waited till the last minute to buy it, I gave it to my parents for christmas anyway & explained what happened, but they said the coffee was pretty decent. So still makes a nice cup of coffee, just not San Francisco Bay Coffee Company coffee.", "target": "3"}

The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.", "target": "3"}

The product reached me melted and fully bloomed (chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface). Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose. They did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment. I ended up paying $25 for the return shipment. The product is a lot costly through this vendor. Actually double its price. I bought a 5kg block of the same chocolate from a local Callebaut vendor. Please research your local listings. Stop buying through these channels. If you want Callebaut chocolates, call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor. While through this vendor the milk/white chocolate for 1kg costed me close to $50 with shipping, I bought the 5kg block from the local distributor for just $47!!", "target": "1"}

It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.  The candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy.  If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.  Therefore, if you want your licorice to remain fresh, I'd recommend placing it in an airtight container.  I've also purchased the raspberry flavor but haven't tried that yet.  I have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as \"licorice,\" but enjoy the confection also.", "target": "5"}
