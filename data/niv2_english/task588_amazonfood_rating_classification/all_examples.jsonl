No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.

When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.

I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.

I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.

The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)", "target": "2"}

The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.

The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.

Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it.

More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2\" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access.

In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.  Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.  So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.

The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store brands.

The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit \"juice concentrate\" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.  At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy beverage.", "target": "3"}

I tried many brands, and have done many side by side tasting comparisons, and Cento San Marzano tomatoes have consistently won out. These tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor, and a nice acid to sugar balance (though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce). It's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest, due to their deep red color and soft texture. Many tomatoes advertise themselves as San Marzanos, but since SM is a type of tomato, they could have been grown anywhere. Not these. These are SM tomatoes grown in the San Marzano region of Italy, in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes. I have no affiliation with Cento, I just love a perfect tomato sauce. Use these tomatoes, be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes, and you'll see what I mean. Even using fresh, locally grown, in-season tomatoes I haven't been able to get the depth of flavor that I do with the Centos.", "target": "5"}

Also, do not be tempted with \"100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E\" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.  The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.  Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?", "target": "3"}

The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that.

It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.  However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.

I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.

They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.

I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).

It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself.

It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.  I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it.

My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)", "target": "4"}

I was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp, tangerine taste.  It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.  And the price for the Switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so I think it would be out of the range for most people's pockets.", "target": "3"}

A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.  The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.  A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.  Not recommending this at all.

I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half.

You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!", "target": "5"}

They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.  Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.  Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.

I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.

A nice combination of grains, coconut and chocolate make this a bar to reach for if you want a quick, easily packable snack that is not unhealthy. With that said, the calories are rather high: 180, and it includes 9 grams of fat, so you couldn't really call it a low-cal snack. I've often had one for breakfast as a kind of meal replacement when I'm in a hurry, with a glass of OJ and felt it satisfied me for a few hours, until lunch time. I like that it's gluten free, even though I don't actually have a gluten allergy that I know of.  But I think it's great that those who do have gluten intolerance are getting more and more choices.Bottom line: this is a nice snack, fairly healthy, and not a bad choice as a quick meal substitute.", "target": "3"}

I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package.

It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.  I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.", "target": "3"}

Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you.

Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label \"yeast extract\".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.  The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.  What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.

If I wanted to buy pop, I'd get a 24 pack for $8 not $30! Honestly, if you want juice, go to your local grocery store.  These are terrible for you, over priced and they taste horrible.  I would've sent them back but I figured I'd give it a try.  Now im out $30.  This left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.  Oh!

These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.  What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny.", "target": "5"}

Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.    Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.  Jerry", "target": "5"}

The mix is just as easy to use as the non-GF alternative and produces the same results.  No crumbles!  How often do you see that in a GF product?  I bought a box at the grocer to test, then went directly to subscribe & save here.  This will be a staple in my GF kitchen.", "target": "5"}

Amazon doesn't seem to specify \"use by\" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.

Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.  To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.  Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them.

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.

You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.

The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.  By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.  ~The Rebecca Review", "target": "5"}
