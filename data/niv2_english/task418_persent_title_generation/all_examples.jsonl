But  when  she  turned to  Fonda  Kelly  decided to ask  her  about  her  appearance  and\u2014specifically\u2014the plastic surgery  she 's had. Faced with this question  Fonda's face said it all.\n\"You've been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully  and with strength. You've admit you've had work done  which I think is to your credit \" said  Kelly .  Kelly  then asked  Fonda  why  she  doesn't feel proud to admit that  she 's had work done.\n\"Well thanks. Good attitude  good posture  take care of  myself   but let me tell you why I love this movie that we did  Our Souls At Night  rather than plastic surgery \" Fonda continued.", "target": "Jane Fonda has zero time for Megyn Kelly's annoying question about her plastic surgery"}
