Oh shoot, I said, I won't be able to keep everyone straight.But I couldn't believe how entertaining it was. The plot is fresh and exciting, with interesting twists and turns nearly every step of the way. I must say that there was only two or three characters I was absolutely in love with, one of them being Princess Dany. I took off half a star in rating because I did not see enough of her in the book that I would have liked. Also, I found it hard to believe that the author killed off the characters that he did. NOTE: There is no happy ending to the first of this series.The writer is very talented and he is definitely one that will forever be remembered.

Principally, because I empathised so much with Hawke's character that I spent at least the first hour of the film trying to make excuses for Washington's character's behaviour. Perhaps I am just slow or naive, but I genuinely could not decide whether Washington was good or evil or just human in this film until the last half hour or so, when it becomes very obvious. I was sitting there debating with myself; is that truly the only way to approach this? Is there no other? I study Criminology and as such, the film was fascinating. I make no pretence that it was a particularly deep or thought-provoking film, only that it did address issues that I am interested in.I fully admit that I am no expert on crime on the streets of L.A. and so I make no judgement about how realistic this film was, except to say that while probably overdramatised, the issues raised are extremely relevant and far more common that you might believe.\nquestion: Is the film fascinating?", "target": "I loved this film"}

It had the best reviews at the lowest price point, so I thought &#34;why not?&#34;First of all, it is a very classy-looking device, with the matte black plastic exterior and a splash of red on the drum.  The aesthetics remind me of an HTC EVO.  It is approximately the size of a tangerine when it's closed, which is a perfectly portable size.This thing can get extremely loud.  Even outdoors the sound travels pretty far and watch out when turning up the volume all the way inside.  I was wrong to expect so much from such a small device, but it is important to note that these speakers are very tinny.  Unfortunately, I can't use these for my personal listening because they absolutely despise bass.If you're looking to buy speakers to improve the sound on your laptop, look elsewhere!  Otherwise, these are well-made speakers with ample volume for portable media players where sound quality isn't much of an issue.\nquestion: How high can the volume be?", "target": "This thing can get extremely loud"}

The lobby of the Ramada is quite cool (it used to be the old City Hall), but the rooms are fairly run down and not particularly clean. All in all, it wouldn't be too bad for the price, but the neighbourhood was not very safe or pleasant. There are not too many businesses in the area (most of the places are shut down permanently) and it is a haven for homeless people.

Truth is it's a chain hotel that pretends not to seek out the corporate clients even though there were plenty of them. However, unlike so many other big name chains, the Omni seems to treat it's private guests very specially going that little step further for customer service. (Too often I find the chains trying to get the corporate money and just neglect those of us that want a nice hotel).Lots of nice little touches too numerous to mention here means I shall return here (and to any other Omni).And was it romantic? - Well this is not a boutique hotel - it's a large-ish city centre hotel.

On their fifth wedding anniversary, a day Amy always celebrates to the hilt, she disappears under mysterious circumstances.  Nick is the prime suspect and does nothing to make his family, the media, or the public think differently.  Thus begins a highly suspenseful tale loaded with twists and turns to keep you eagerly turning the pages.  I am in awe of author Gillian Flynn's clever plotting and now anxious to read her two previous books.  To go more deeply into the story line would involve spoilers, so I will avoid that and just say Amy and Nick are two of the most dysfunctional, psychotic people you may ever come across.

As Stanely Kubrick's last movie it shows what the director was capable of but is rather lacking at  the same time.Despite what many have said about the film, it isn't a  porno movie. Sorry.  It is a series of adventures into a intresting dream  world.  Every scene is very well shot and unique.  In fact it's fair to say  that the whole isn't the sum of it's parts.  While all the different  encounters Tom Cruis's character has are well-done and intresting, they  don't fell connected and the story falls apart quickly.  Also, the audience  never really gets a sense of Cruis's or Kidman's character.The film  also feels rather incomplete.

This DVD is excellent, besides the show I really enjoyed the documentary on the 2nd disc is very good. I would like to see a documentary on the whole band cause I would think that would be intresting. Rush is a excellent live band, what's cool about there live music is that it changes from time to time, you listen to &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot; on  A Show Of Hands and Different Stages thou the lyrics are the same the music is slightly different and that's what I like about Rush's live stuff is that they evolve musically and it very cool to listen to.\nquestion: Is the music cool?", "target": "RUSH IN RIO is a excellent 2-disc DVD set"}

It truly is a cross between Monty Python and Tommy Boy. Many people hate it when a passion. I can understand that. It's not that kind of humor that many people like. My parents do not get it at all. However, all my friends think it is the one of the best comedies ever made. This is much like Easy Rider. I think it is one of the most pointless movies ever made, but I also did not live through the 60's so the whole point of the movie was lost on me. For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better). I would say if your over 30, it's very unlikely that you will like ND, but give it a try, you might like it.

Fire pits located right adjacent to the driveway often had &quot;out of order&quot; signs posted and the remainder were surrounded by patrons with cigarettes. The rooms were spacious but the strange rectangular &quot;pillow&quot; in the bed just created a nuisance and the lack of separate light switch for the room with the toilet (separate from the space with the sink) lit up the entire room during nighttime use.

No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it.
