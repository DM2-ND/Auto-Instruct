Using a Keurig model that makes a 4-oz. cup of coffee, this k-cup produces a rich, dark, full-bodied espresso that can be enjoyed as is or used to make espresso drinks. If you use the 6-oz setting, the coffee will be strong and rich but will not have the body of espresso. I've tried just about every other dark, Italian and French roast k-cup on the market and I definitely prefer this one for espresso. One caveat: if you don't like Starbucks' dark roasts, this may be too strong or dark for your taste. I tried this as a brew-over-ice, but did not like it as much, as the cold temperature seemed to bring out bitter and muddy flavors in the brew. However, for a hot espresso or espresso drink, I always keep this k-cup on hand.\nquestion: Is coffee good?", "target": "rich , dark , full - bodied espresso"}

Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again.\nquestion: Is coffee good?", "target": "good coffee"}

The building is one of the few that survived the earthquake and fire and it has all of the touches from that period that you do not see in modern hotels: high ceilings, crown moulding, wide hallways with large wooden doors, large rooms, and a gorgeous and ornate dining room with a glass ceiling. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Service is crisp.

We had a bunch of the tacos, and all were perfect. A big standout for me was their shrimp taco. The shrimp inside was breaded and fried, which made me nervous that it would only taste like batter and oil. I was so wrong. It had a wonderful shrimp flavor that was perfectly complemented by the sauce. The beef cheek was also a highlight.

I think it is one of the most pointless movies ever made, but I also did not live through the 60's so the whole point of the movie was lost on me. For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better).

The bed was comfy and the sheets were super soft. The room itself was kind of small and there wasn't much space to unpack a suitcase, but the bathroom was huge with a gorgeous, large tub and separate shower. I'm a sucker for a beautiful bathroom! I also loved that they had dvds we could borrow to watch in the room when we didn't feel like leaving the hotel. The front desk folks were friendly and helpful and very accommodating. We ate dinner in the Roots restaurant and shared a delicious organic salad, free-range, organic pork chops and a yummy dessert. After dinner, we ordered cocktails from the bar and wandered up to the rooftop garden to take in the view. Overall, a lovely time plus I feel like I gained some good karma points just by staying here. :)\nquestion: Is your bed comfortable?", "target": "The bed was comfy and the sheets were super soft"}

The cinematography here is outstanding, the \"choreography\", if you will, pure genius, and the acting/direction of the highest quality. Not a film made to please the \"masses\". It's not Spielberg or Howard. This film, like Bergman's, deals with the complexity of feelings and the interaction of its characters. It is by far the best performance ever by Dunst, and where has the brillant Charlotte Gainsbourg been all my life (what a \"face\" packed with character).

But there's nothing worse than getting everything ready to find that your tea bag broke and your have leaves floating in your tea. So now with the Lipton Pyramid, you won't have that problem anymore. The pyramid itself is made of a mesh material that's very strong so it won't have a problem with breaking. And the tea itself is delicious. The flavor of it was very delicate and relaxing.

The food is not authentic and way too overpriced. The Hainanese Chicken was overcooked and tough. The ginger sauce is not made property and it should be combined with green onions. The authentic version should also comes with a bowl of chicken stock. Many of the menu items can be found in a typical Chinese restaurant at a much cheaper price and better quality. However, I do enjoy the drinks that they make. We only came to Hawker Bar since an acquaintance and so called 'food critic' recommended it.

When I'm out, my idea of a great coffee is Starbuck's Pike's Place with cold soy milk and  a packet of Sugar in the Raw. At home, I was using green Mountain Nantucket blend, which I found a little too mild. I say this so you can get a point of reference, as I found the San Francisco Bay Coffee to be just right. I use about 8-9 ounces of water and it comes out with a bolder flavor than the Nantucket blend. The coffee is very smooth and rich.As for the design of the K-Cup, it worked perfectly in my Cuisinart machine.The cups come in plastic bags and need to be transferred to zip-lock bags so they don't make the kitchen smell like coffee, though would be fine with me.Anyway, I feel it is a great value; it meets all of my needs, works in my machine, and tastes great too.\nquestion: How good is coffee?", "target": "When I 'm out , idea of great coffee is Starbuck 's Pike 's"}

As with all their products, their blackberry vanilla herbal tea holds to that high standard. This tea has a smooth, robust flavor that is delicious both unsweetened and sweetened, and is delicious when served hot or cold. My personal preference is to drink it hot and very lightly sweetened to help bring out the vanilla flavor more. One of my favorite things about Lipton tea is that the bags don't tear or come open easily, the one brand I can count on to not leak tea leaf bits into the liquid. Great quality, great flavor, no funny aftertaste.\nquestion: Was the taste weak?", "target": "great flavor"}

It had the best reviews at the lowest price point, so I thought &#34;why not?&#34;First of all, it is a very classy-looking device, with the matte black plastic exterior and a splash of red on the drum.  The aesthetics remind me of an HTC EVO.  It is approximately the size of a tangerine when it's closed, which is a perfectly portable size.This thing can get extremely loud.  Even outdoors the sound travels pretty far and watch out when turning up the volume all the way inside.  I was wrong to expect so much from such a small device, but it is important to note that these speakers are very tinny.  Unfortunately, I can't use these for my personal listening because they absolutely despise bass.If you're looking to buy speakers to improve the sound on your laptop, look elsewhere!  Otherwise, these are well-made speakers with ample volume for portable media players where sound quality isn't much of an issue.\nquestion: How high can the volume be?", "target": "This thing can get extremely loud"}

This lens is one of the best I have ever used on any kind of camera. It not only has a good professional look and feel to it, but it works flawlessly with the smoothness of lenses in a much higher price range. Images are clean and crisp, and the autofocus is butter smooth. I paid a bit over $500 for mine and I doubt there is a nickels worth of difference, except in price, between the Sigma brand and a comparable lens bearing the Nikon name.

Like others we did not feel safe as soon as we left the hotel, even in the middle of the day. The rooms were not particularly clean and our final night was ruined by the incompetence of the hotel staff. They offered to check us in on line for our flight home but failed to print our boarding cards or seat us together. They did not try to fix the problem and we were left to go on the internet at $5 a go and stay on hold to the airlines helpdesk, the whole episode taking about 2 hours. We also had to get to the airport over 4 hours ahead of our flight to ensure we could get boarding cards and ended up paying a further $110 so that we could sit together.

The cooked contents filled up 60% of the container.There was an ample amount of dried apple and walnut in each serving, and there were even quite a few pieces of dried cranberry.  The apple, walnut, and cranberry pieces all tasted good.  The cooked oatmeal was a bit mushy, and with 22 grams of sugar in a relatively small amount of oatmeal (each serving is 75 grams),  the whole thing came out just a bit too sweet for my taste, and I'm not too crazy about the 290 calories you get per serving either.\nquestion: What kind of oatmeal do you like?", "target": "The apple walnut and cranberry pieces all tasted good"}

It's fast (considering I just upgraded from FD, basically), has great optics, works great as a portrait lens. I dispute claims that it's noisy, as it sounds quite silent next to the sound of my 20D's shutter.Unfortunately it feels like it came out of a cereal box. The lack of a metal mount makes me wonder. And I worry that my lens doesn't say \"MADE IN JAPAN\". Still, the day I got it it fell off my printer onto the floor, about a four foot drop, which it survived entirely without a scratch... we'll see how that goes. One major ergonomic disadvantage, apart from the fact that in your hands the lens feels like something that came out of the cereal box, is the fact that the focusing ring is, like, right at the end of the lens, and is easily turned while holding the lens. I don't have a hood yet, so I sometimes run into problems when I'm holding the lens.\nquestion: Does the optics good?", "target": "has great optics"}
