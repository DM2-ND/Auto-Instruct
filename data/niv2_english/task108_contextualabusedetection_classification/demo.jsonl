It's the default thing they say about Obama. Like when Biden said Obama was the first black guy to run who was \"clean\".    I never see them say the same stuff about their white politicians. It's pure low expectations racism. Just imagine talking about your black friend and saying \"yea, my back friend is cool. And he even talks well! And he's clean! How cool is that?\" My black friends would punch me in the face.", "target": "yes"}
