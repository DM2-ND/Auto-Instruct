First, no one cares about what Trudeau said about Castro, outside of a few rabid conservatives and the various leadership candidates of the CPC who think they can appeal to that rabid base. The really interesting question here is why these people are so lost in the past that they are fighting and evoking tropes from the Cold War. Don't they know that is over? Second, discussing Castro outside of the historical context is ludicrous. Castro is controversial precisely because he did  a lot of good along with the bad. As far as Latin American dictators go, Castro was one of the better ones  - a man who really did improve life for the great majority of his country's citizens, even as he resisted brutal American oppression. Through the 1960-1980s, Cuba was one of the best places in the region to live - much better than the American-backed vicious right wing dictatorships that slaughtered  their own people. That is what the rest of the world -and Trudeau -remembers.", "target": "Disagree"}
