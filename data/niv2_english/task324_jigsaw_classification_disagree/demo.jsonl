Press in the United States doesn't hurt us right now when we are in the midst of needing to increase our profile as the NAFTA negotiations begin.  The sad story is that there wasn't much interest in Harper internationally or frankly at home....he was boring and didn't accomplish nearly as much on behalf of regular Canadians as you would like to believe.", "target": "Disagree"}
