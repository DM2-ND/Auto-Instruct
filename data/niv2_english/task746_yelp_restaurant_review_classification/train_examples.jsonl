Lots of 'um, ah' and 'I guess' replies.Not impressedPerhaps I just got a temp in both instances but really, I didnt feel very welcome.I will likely still join and try it for a month. The relatively low cost should negate any abuse, as long as they apply quality service when really needed.I will report back once I have had a chance to really test the system.", "target": "negative"}
