It was the beginning of a holiday weekend, so timing was urgent to get there before they closed. After not hearing from them, I called them in the afternoon. He supposedly had trouble with his truck and was going to send someone else. Just got a call from the backup driver...he knew absolutely nothing and had just gotten an urgent call for a tow. He (the second driver) thought I was stranded somewhere. So now, after a no show, no call, it is too late for the car to be towed in time for anything to get done. Will never call them again...", "target": "negative"}

This is a great place to go with friends, and don't be intimidated by the line that snakes out the door -- there is great people watching to be done on South Congress!", "target": "positive"}

They not only took forever to answer the phone. The delivery took over an hour (which is fine). But hr asked for Cheese & Peppers (because I like to eat my pizza the way I want)! And still nothing. So we call back real quick to catch the driver to see if he has any in his car. BUT.... NOBODY WILL ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE! It's now 10pm at night on a Saturday and they still haven't answered the phone. So now myself and my friend will get delivery elsewhere and spread the word that this location can't take simple orders and they certainly don't know how to answer the damn phone .", "target": "negative"}
