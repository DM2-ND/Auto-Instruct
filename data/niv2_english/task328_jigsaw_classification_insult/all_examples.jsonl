The only difference is that this war is based on religion.  It is a  sectarian conflict. The rebels are all Sunni Muslims, and are ultra-conservative. They are backed by the Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  And since they are both \"allies\" of the US, we have joined in and are backing the rebels too.\n\nOn the other side you have Shia Muslims all aligned to support the Syrian Government, including Shia Iran, as well as the Shia Hezbollah Army in Lebanon.  And since Syria is an ally of Russia, Russia is supporting them too.\n\nIt is a total lie that the rebels are either progressive or democratic.  All of the religious minorities in Syria have joined in supporting the government, which has always been very tolerant of religious minorities.  \n\nThere is no reason for the United States to be supporting this war.   We are 100% facilitating this human tragedy, and helping make it happen.\n\nWHY??", "target": "Non-insult"}

The dramatic effect produced was an attack by Trump on Syrian government forces.  The Syrian government had reasons not to use CW rather than to use them.  If an entire rebel held town had been wiped out, one might concede that government forces would do it to avoid street-to-street fighting, i.e. a military benefit that would save some of its soldier's lives.  That is not what happened.  A small number (in the overall context) of people were apparently killed by chemicals.  Use of CW to cause this small pocket of deaths provided negligible military advantage but did provide dramatic effect, a high probability dramatic effect, of opening direct conflict between the Syrian government and the US.  In the end, Assad cannot survive US involvement; therefore, out of his self interest, he would not use CW.  The rebels win big through their use.", "target": "Non-insult"}

Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine.

Sweden's biggest challenge will be how they handle the upcoming liberal-muslim conflict over Sweden's traditional liberal agenda, or, the inevitable Muslim male pressure to formally adopt Sharia Law after years of surreptiously running it without government approval.

Currently, police confront aggressively and thus place themselves in harm's way.  Consequently, police shoot to kill to protect themselves at the first, often misinterpreted, sign of threat.  Once in a while aggressive approach is necessary.  Usually, the matter in question is not so important and it would be better to let the perp go rather than to kill him.

We already have a surplus of 2-3 million newcomers in Canada plus 1 million foreign labor. What Canada has to do is have a tight labor supply, so that the job vacancy rate stays above 3.5%, starting by reducing immigration rates by 90% and making sure 90% of desired population growth comes from Canadian born children. No more of this abuse and utter absurdity of having work opportunities and taxpayer resources going to people in need that aren't already citizens here . Wake-up Canadians!

I am just saying that turning to Jesus and trusting in His grace (that He gives to those who humbly approach Him) to help them deal with even the most difficult of situations (whether that be being married and pregnant but fearful of not being financially capable of raising the child, becoming pregnant through a one night stand or being the victim of rape or incest)! With God, Mark all things are possible. Mark, I do believe that abortion destroys God's creation. God created man and then created the fish in the sea and the animals but He gave man dominion of the fish in the sea and the animals. He gave us fish and meat to eat.

Church marriage law presumes that a married couple will have intercourse unless proven otherwise. Then, the burden of proof was on Catherine, and the operative word is \"proof\". Catherine's unsupported word should not have sufficed, and at the time she made this claim, she was not a virgin. Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.\n\nHowever, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost. Pope Clement VII did not want a re-run of that war, so he stalled by taking Catherine's claim seriously. There were special commissions and so on to waste time.", "target": "Non-insult"}

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.", "target": "Non-insult"}

Was it or was it not the fact that congress with a woman rendered a priest impure for the sacrifice?  Be honest.

Richard Rohr, OFM, whom I see as a modern day Merton, speaks so clearly about our inability to believe we are loved unconditionally by God, and therefore set up all sorts of limitations to God's grace, believing ourselves to be somehow  unworthy of God's love or thinking we have to earn it.\nThe last of my cancer patients, to whom I have been ministering, went joyously Home to the Kingdom's Feast, and it was my privilege to be with them as their journeys ended.

Studies indicate that 20% of all white people have used multiple kinds of illegal drugs, compared to 10% of all blacks and Latinos.

On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.", "target": "Non-insult"}

I understand that the Koine Greek word \"porneia\" is debated, but I read an intriguing argument for its being translated as \"adultery\" - in the sense of secretive sexual intercourse with a man other than the woman's husband - as the more accurate term.

However, when you have spoken to the complainant, then the suspect, and any witnesses involved, and there is no evidence, it is time to go.  This is where the unfounded come in.   Once the matter is headed for the courts, I fully support the complainant, because there is evidence to support the allegations.

His knowledge come from his own eyes and not from any extrajudicial denunciation or any inquiry that he might set up. But these are unusual circumstances. Most of the bishops\u2019 knowledge comes from someone complaining to him about the abuse by a priest under his control, and those allegations are covered by the secret. Those who accidentally come across this information are also bound by the secret. Francis knows about the secret because the Argentinian protocol which was two years in the drafting, was signed off by his fellow bishops one month after he became pope. Art 17 states \u201cas a first warning\u201d that these cases are subject to the pontifical secret.", "target": "Non-insult"}

My hypothesis there was that the current western epidemic of sexual attraction/identification disorders currently results in large part from the irrational belief that men and women are to all intents and purposes identical.  It's not instructive to equate western-style \u201cgay\u201d homosexuality with animal behaviour.  Simply because a behaviour can be found, commonly or rarely, among animals does not make it moral (that\u2019s not what \u2018natural law\u2019 means).

Seems everyone is up in arms over Phoenix being transgender or our politicians disagreeing with lifestyle choices of Alaskan's. Most Alaskan's I know could care less about what someone's personal business is unless it brings harm to others. Certainly the LGBT community doesn't. Kelly doesn't really care that Phoenix is transgender. Neither do the rest of them. What they are worried about is losing a slice of their power & control and they think Phoenix might be the guy to do it. My concern? I could care less that he's transgender either. What I care about is that Phoenix has been in the state for a relatively short time and prior to being here was a pastor. His skill set might be great for that, but how is he qualified to be a commissioner of the Alaska State Human Rights Commission? My other concern is he was picked by Walker. That man's decisions have been less than stellar and frankly, I don't trust anything he thinks is a good idea.", "target": "Non-insult"}

I don't deny the importance of doctrine, but I do deny that it has supreme importance.

These are all reasonable options, but they didn't satisfy America's lust for retaliation.\n\nThe American invasion of Afghanistan was not authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Hence it violated international law. Neither was the invasion justified by modern standards comparing similar events. Example: the UK didn't invade Ireland because of the IRA, despite a hundred years of bombings and terrorism. And finally, it wasn't justified on humanitarian grounds. Despite having absolutely nothing to do with 9/11, tens of thousands of Afghan civilians died due to the American invasion and occupation.
