Yet the RG editors allow this sort of rot. Hillary Clinton is your compulsive liar, who has broken numerous federal statutes. Removing classified material is a felony, and that's for starters. Mrs. Clinton has said \"She doesn't remember,\" and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims. The Middle East is aflame today because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, threatening the security of the US and our allies.  Yet all crybaby leftists can do is blubber what a big meanie Donald Trump is.", "target": "Insult"}
