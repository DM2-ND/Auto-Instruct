Even when we were not together she would look at my instagram, see who liked my pictures, see who followed me, see who i followed etc.. i always felt watched and judged all the time. So that\u2019s mostly the reason we broke up, it was a good breakup though, no fight, we left as friends and we haven\u2019t spoke much after that. Now though, 2 months later, i\u2019m still feeling like she is constantly watching my instagram, even though i have no idea if she does or doesn\u2019t. But it just makes me feel bad, and i\u2019m thinking about blocking her on all social media. It would come off as very random to her, since it\u2019s gone 2 months and we don\u2019t really have anything against each other, we could call us friends. Would i be the asshole if i block her?", "target": "blocking my ex-girlfriend from social media, even though we have nothing against each other atm"}

I\u2019m was like \u201cyeah, no duh, it\u2019s the first thing the dentist tells you after they finish\u201d. \n\nI also keep getting HORRIBLE advice about credit cards to (they keep saying to close the accounts I\u2019ve paid off, even though it would kill my score because the accounts are old).\n\nSame for \u201coh, you can sneak an extra gallon of gas into your car if you pull the handle\u201d. Ummmm, no shit stain, when you do that on my car, it just spills out, but thanks for telling me how to gas up my car that I\u2019ve been driving for 3 years.\n\nI\u2019m 35 years old and have had enough experience in life to figure a lot of things out.
