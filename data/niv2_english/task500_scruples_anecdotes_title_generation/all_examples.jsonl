Recently, he bought a video game and was now low on cash. \n\nNow on Friday, we were out of food and needed to do grocery shopping again. I wasn't feeling up to going out so my brother said he'd do the shopping on his own, but he'll need my card since he was running low on cash, to which I declined. I had planned to visit my gf in Birmingham during the weekend (I told him about this prior), I didn't want to risk the chance that I might not have enough cash for all stuff I might end up doing there. I then bring up the fact that if he hadn't gone and bought that video game he could have funded groceries. He didn't argue about it and just let it be, but I could tell he was upset about it.

My roommate and I will be sharing this dorm room for the fall 2018 and spring 2019 semesters. \n\nBefore I left for winter break she asked me if she could invite some guy over so she could have sex and I told her no. Over the past couple of months, she's been going on nonstop tender dates hooking up with random people and I don't want our dorm room to be one of her new hookup spots to start inviting strangers. \n\nThe idea of having strangers over makes me afraid of getting my stuff stolen. It also really doesn't help that I'm kind of a germaphobe when it comes to things that involve nudity and the different assortments of fluids that can come from the human body (main reason I'm still a virgin, avoid relationships, and clean the bathroom before and after I use it).\n\nShe says I'm being unreasonable. I know some of my practices and beliefs can be a little extreme, but AITA in this situation.", "target": "telling my roommate she can't have sex in our dorm room"}

About a year ago, I reached out to my friend to tell him that she was cheating on him, and should do something about it. He felt conflicted because the only proof I had at the time was just some of the first hand accounts where she\u2019s dancing with other guys or she\u2019s being flirty when he\u2019s not around. They are long distance, and when we go out to bars, I constantly find her in situations where she\u2019s dancing with other dudes. Fast forward, they\u2019re still together, and now I have some more proof where i have personally heard her say she\u2019s made out with other dudes/ wants to fuck one of her co-workers. \n\nThe reason I haven\u2019t told him lately is because I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t do anything, plus she is best friends with my gf as well and I am afraid of effecting their relationship.
