There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund, which was the only positive part of the experience. \n Polarity: Negative", "target": "True"}

This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.  As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored. \n Polarity: Negative", "target": "True"}
