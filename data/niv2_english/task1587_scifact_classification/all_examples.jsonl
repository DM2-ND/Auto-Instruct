Little research has been carried out on the infrastructure required to support public health programs. This article describes the results of an interactive process to develop a research agenda for public health workforce development to inform all those with stakes in the public health system. This research is defined as a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, both basic and applied, that examines the workforce in terms of costs, quality, accessibility, delivery, organization, financing, and outcomes of public health services to increase knowledge and understanding of the relationships among workforce and structure, processes, and effects of public health services. A logic model and five priority research areas resulted from meetings of expert panels during 2000 to 2003. Innovative public and private partnerships will be required to advance cross-cutting and systems-focused research..

We examined the reliability and validity of the PCS in adult community and pain outpatient samples. The PCS showed a high internal consistency in both groups. Using data from the community sample, confirmatory factor analyses showed that the PCS taps a single construct characterized by three related dimensions. Gender differences were obtained on the PCS total score in the community and the outpatient samples. The analyses also showed significant differences between the community and the outpatient samples on the PCS total and subscales. Overall, the results showed strong evidence of criterion-related, concurrent, and discriminant validity for the PCS in the community sample. Limitations of the present study are discussed..

Oncogenes such as ras, src, raf, and mos have been proposed to transform cells by prolonging the activated state of MAPKK and of components downstream in the signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, constitutively active MAPKK mutants were designed that had basal activities up to 400 times greater than that of the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase. Expression of these mutants in mammalian cells activated AP-1-regulated transcription. The cells formed transformed foci, grew efficiently in soft agar, and were highly tumorigenic in nude mice. These findings indicate that constitutive activation of MAPKK is sufficient to promote cell transformation..

We developed a proteomic technique called \"quantitative temporal viromics\" (QTV), which employs multiplexed tandem-mass-tag-based mass spectrometry. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is not only an important pathogen but a paradigm of viral immune evasion. QTV detailed how HCMV orchestrates the expression of >8,000 cellular proteins, including 1,200 cell-surface proteins to manipulate signaling pathways and counterintrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune defenses. QTV predicted natural killer and T cell ligands, as well as 29 viral proteins present at the cell surface, potential therapeutic targets. Temporal profiles of >80% of HCMV canonical genes and 14 noncanonical HCMV open reading frames were defined.

Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

In contrast to this view, we observed no active stem cells and little cell turnover in adult hindgut tissue based on clonal marking and BrdU incorporation studies. Again contradicting the previous proposal, we showed that the adult hindgut is not generated by anterior stem cells during larval/pupal development. However, severe tissue damage within the hindgut elicits cell proliferation within a ring of putative quiescent stem cells at the anterior of the pylorus. Thus, the hindgut does not provide a model of tissue maintenance by constitutively active stem cells, but has great potential to illuminate mechanisms of stress-induced tissue repair..

We have implemented a Monte Carlo method for four 'chi-squared' test statistics, three of which involved combination of alleles, and evaluated their performance on a real data set. Combining rare alleles to avoid small expected cell counts, and considering each allele in turn against the rest, reduced the power to detect a genuine association when the number of alleles was very large.

We demonstrated that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are major sources of chemokines that recruit granulocytes to tumors. CSF1 produced by tumor cells caused HDAC2-mediated downregulation of granulocyte-specific chemokine expression in CAF, which limited migration of these cells to tumors. Treatment with CSF1R inhibitors disrupted this crosstalk and triggered a profound increase in granulocyte recruitment to tumors.

It is ubiquitous, and following resolution of primary productive infection, it persists in the human host by establishing a lifelong latent infection in myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes and their progenitors. Most adults with HCMV infection are healthy but it can cause neurologic deficits in infants, and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patient. Microarray-based studies of HCMV have provided useful information about genes that are transcriptionally active during both productive and latent phases of infection.

Representatives from transplant centers that utilize the National Kidney Registry database to facilitate donor exchange transplants developed a financial model applicable to paired donor exchanges and donor chain transplants. The first tenet of the model is to eliminate financial liability to the donor. Thereafter, it accounts for the donor evaluation, donor nephrectomy hospital costs, donor nephrectomy physician fees, organ transport, donor complications and recipient inpatient services. Billing between hospitals is based on Medicare cost report defined costs rather than charges.

Utilizing in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, we show that normal and cancer human mammary epithelial cells with increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH) have stem/progenitor properties. These cells contain the subpopulation of normal breast epithelium with the broadest lineage differentiation potential and greatest growth capacity in a xenotransplant model. In breast carcinomas, high ALDH activity identifies the tumorigenic cell fraction, capable of self-renewal and of generating tumors that recapitulate the heterogeneity of the parental tumor. In a series of 577 breast carcinomas, expression of ALDH1 detected by immunostaining correlated with poor prognosis.

In addition, low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas have pathologic and molecular characteristics distinct from high-grade serous carcinomas, yet similar to serous tumors of low malignant potential. This suggests a common pathogenesis and a continuum of disease from serous tumors of low malignant potential to low-grade serous carcinomas.

If true, this notion might guide new strategies to improve antibiotic efficacy. In this study, the model was directly tested. Contrary to the hypothesis, antibiotic treatment did not accelerate the formation of hydrogen peroxide in Escherichia coli and did not elevate intracellular free iron, an essential reactant for the production of lethal damage. Lethality persisted in the absence of oxygen, and DNA repair mutants were not hypersensitive, undermining the idea that toxicity arose from oxidative DNA lesions. We conclude that these antibiotic exposures did not produce ROS and that lethality more likely resulted from the direct inhibition of cell-wall assembly, protein synthesis, and DNA replication..

Despite a lack of direct presentation by migratory DCs, blocking their egress from infected skin substantially inhibited class I-restricted presentation and HSV-specific CTL responses. These results support the argument for initial transport of antigen by migrating DCs, followed by its transfer to the lymphoid-resident DCs for presentation and CTL priming. Given that relatively robust CTL responses were seen with small numbers of skin-emigrant DCs, we propose that this inter-DC antigen transfer functions to amplify presentation across a larger network of lymphoid-resident DCs for efficient T cell activation..

We determined the most appropriate model for alignments of 177 RNA virus genes and 106 yeast genes, using 11 substitution models including one codon model and four CP models. The majority of analyzed gene alignments are best described by CP substitution models, rather than by standard nucleotide models, and without the computational cost of full codon models.

The extent of this additional cortical progenitor expansion differs among primates, leading to differences in the number of neurons generated by each progenitor cell.

Respectively, these groups were approximately four, two, and six times as likely as the control group to receive HCV testing and about seven, two, and eight times as likely to be infected. The rate of interferon (IFN) therapy was significantly lower for the substance use group and the group with co-occurring disorders.

Individual neuromodulators can have divergent actions in a neuron by targeting multiple physiological mechanisms. Conversely, multiple neuromodulators may have convergent actions through overlapping targets. The divergent and convergent neuromodulator actions can be unambiguously synergistic or antagonistic, but neuromodulation often entails balanced adjustment of nonlinear membrane and synaptic properties by targeting ion channel and synaptic dynamics rather than just excitability or synaptic strength. In addition, neuromodulators can exert effects at multiple timescales, from short-term adjustments of neuron and synapse function to persistent long-term regulation.

The maturation process of flaviviruses is directed by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. We have determined the 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a recombinant protein in which the dengue virus prM is linked to the envelope glycoprotein E. The structure represents the prM-E heterodimer and fits well into the cryo-electron microscopy density of immature virus at neutral pH. The pr peptide beta-barrel structure covers the fusion loop in E, preventing fusion with host cell membranes. The structure provides a basis for identifying the stages of its pH-directed conformational metamorphosis during maturation, ending with release of pr when budding from the host..

The mechanism involves the regulation of cellular redox through an mTORC1/c-Myc pathway of stromal glucose and amino acid metabolism, resulting in increased stromal IL-6 production, which is required for tumor promotion in the epithelial compartment. Thus, p62 is an anti-inflammatory tumor suppressor that acts through the modulation of metabolism in the tumor stroma..

It enhances the secretion of insulin, but attenuates insulin's metabolic actions in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, conflicting evidence indicates a lack of knowledge of the timing of these events during the development of obesity and diabetes, pointing to a key gap in our understanding of metabolic disease. This Perspective reviews alternate viewpoints and recent results on the temporal and mechanistic connections between hyperinsulinemia, obesity and insulin resistance. Although much attention has addressed early steps in the insulin signaling cascade, insulin resistance in obesity seems to be largely elicited downstream of these steps. New findings also connect insulin resistance to extensive metabolic cross-talk between the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas and skeletal muscle.

Application of this nerve-derived transglutaminase to rat optic nerves, in which the injury had caused the loss of visual evoked potential response to light, promoted the recovery of that response within 6 weeks after injury.

It has been thought that the incoherent FFL is designed simply to induce a transient response shaped by a 'fast activation and delayed inhibition'.

Why do the structurally identical incoherent FFLs play such different dynamical roles? Through computational studies, we show that the dynamics of the two types of incoherent FFLs are mutually exclusive.

A number of the trials, however, reported the study using the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles. Hence, in order to combine results, one may have to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials. In this paper, we propose to improve the existing literature in several directions. First, we show that the sample standard deviation estimation in Hozo et al. (2005) has some serious limitations and is always less satisfactory in practice. Inspired by this, we propose a new estimation method by incorporating the sample size. Second, we systematically study the sample mean and standard deviation estimation problem under more general settings where the first and third quartiles are also available for the trials. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methods greatly improve the existing methods and enrich the literature.

Specifically, we show that miR-671 directs cleavage of a circular antisense transcript of the Cerebellar Degeneration-Related protein 1 (CDR1) locus in an Ago2-slicer-dependent manner. The resulting downregulation of circular antisense has a concomitant decrease in CDR1 mRNA levels, independently of heterochromatin formation.

Partial chemical cleavage of the most highly conserved viral proteins resulted in patterns which differed from those of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Furthermore, nucleic acid hybridization experiments were capable of discriminating between the virus types.

We have previously shown that the T cell receptor (TCR) exists as different-sized oligomers on the surface of resting T cells and that large oligomers are preferentially activated in response to low antigen doses. Through biochemistry and electron microscopy, we now showed that previously stimulated and memory T cells have more and larger TCR oligomers at the cell surface than their naive counterparts. Reconstitution of cells and mice with a point mutant of the CD3\u03b6 subunit, which impairs TCR oligomer formation, demonstrated that the increased size of TCR oligomers was directly responsible for the increased sensitivity of antigen-experienced T cells.

Whether stress arises from external insults or defects due to mutation and disease, cells must be able to respond precisely to mount the appropriate defenses. Multi-faceted stress responses are generally coupled with arrest of growth and cell-cycle progression, which both limits the transmission of damaged materials and serves to reallocate limited cellular resources toward defense. Therefore, stress defense versus rapid growth represent competing interests in the cell. How eukaryotic cells set the balance between defense versus proliferation, and in particular knowledge of the regulatory networks that control this decision, are poorly understood. In this perspective, we expand upon our recent work inferring the stress-activated signaling network in budding yeast, which captures pathways controlling stress defense and regulators of growth and cell-cycle progression.

Mutant SOD1 protein induced a transcriptional signature indicative of increased oxidative stress, reduced mitochondrial function, altered subcellular transport, and activation of the ER stress and unfolded protein response pathways. Functional studies demonstrated that these pathways were perturbed in a manner dependent on the SOD1 mutation.

The paper uses information on 1,677 individuals who first became homeless when they were 18 or younger. Three-quarters of the sample had progressed to adult homelessness (defined as 25 or older) and one-quarter were now young adults aged 19 to 24. The findings confirm that the longer people are homeless, the more difficult it becomes to get out of homelessness. However, the social adaptation account overstates the extent to which people accept homelessness as a 'way of life'.

Such remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics progresses with the chronological age of a yeast cell and ultimately causes significant changes in mitochondrial membrane lipidome. These changes in the composition of membrane phospholipids alter mitochondrial abundance and morphology, thereby triggering changes in the age-related chronology of such longevity-defining redox processes as mitochondrial respiration, the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, the preservation of cellular homeostasis of mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species, and the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis..

The short life span of a sir2 mutant also reveals a direct failure to repress recombination generated by the Fob1p-mediated replication block in the rDNA. Sir2p is a limiting component in promoting yeast longevity, and increasing the gene dosage extends the life span in wild-type cells.

Best response dynamics is a dynamic process in which the frequency of a strategy increases only if it is a best response to the present strategy distribution. Gilboa and Matsui ( Econometrica 59 (1991), 859\u2013867) proposed a stability concept directly derived from this dynamic process.

Here, we show that Survivin is controlled in peripheral T cells by OX40 cosignaling via sustained PI3k and PKB activation. Survivin is induced by OX40 independent of mitotic progression in late G1, and blocking Survivin suppresses S-phase transition and division of T cells and leads to apoptosis. Moreover, Survivin expression alone is sufficient to restore proliferation and to antagonize apoptosis in costimulation-deficient T cells and can rescue T cell expansion in vivo. Survivin allows effector T cells to accumulate in large numbers, but Bcl-2 family proteins are required for T cell survival after the phase of active division. Thus, sustained Survivin expression from costimulatory signaling maintains T cell division over time and regulates the extent of clonal expansion..

Here, we describe systematic determination of yeast transcription factor DNA-binding specificities. We obtained binding specificities for 112 DNA-binding proteins representing 19 distinct structural classes. One-third of the binding specificities have not been previously reported. Several binding sequences have striking genomic distributions relative to transcription start sites, supporting their biological relevance and suggesting a role in promoter architecture. Among these are Rsc3 binding sequences, containing the core CGCG, which are found preferentially approximately 100 bp upstream of transcription start sites. Mutation of RSC3 results in a dramatic increase in nucleosome occupancy in hundreds of proximal promoters containing a Rsc3 binding element, but has little impact on promoters lacking Rsc3 binding sequences, indicating that Rsc3 plays a broad role in targeting nucleosome exclusion at yeast promoters..

Inhibitors of the oncogene product MDMX therefore might help reactivate p53 and enhance the efficacy of DNA-damaging drugs. However, we currently lack a quantitative understanding of how MDMX inhibition affects the p53 signaling pathway and cell sensitivity to DNA damage. Live cell imaging showed that MDMX depletion triggered two distinct phases of p53 accumulation in single cells: an initial postmitotic pulse, followed by low-amplitude oscillations. The response to DNA damage was sharply different in these two phases; in the first phase, MDMX depletion was synergistic with DNA damage in causing cell death, whereas in the second phase, depletion of MDMX inhibited cell death.

A number of cellular transport processes support this organization, including active targeting of proteins and passive corralling between compartments. The axon initial segment (AIS), which separates the somatodendritic and axonal compartments, has a key role in neuronal physiology, as both the initiation site of action potentials and the gatekeeper of the axonal arborization. Over the years, the AIS main components and their interactions have been progressively unraveled, as well as their role in the AIS assembly and maintenance. Two mechanisms have been shown to contribute to the regulation of protein transport at the AIS: a surface diffusion barrier and an intracellular traffic filter. However, a molecular understanding of these processes is still lacking. In the view of recent results on the AIS cytoskeleton structure, we will discuss how a better knowledge of the AIS architecture can help understanding its role in the regulation of protein transport and the maintenance of axonal identity..

In experiment II the accuracy of localizing one speech source in a mixture of multiple speech sources was determined. An extra sound source was added to an existing set of sound sources, and the task was to localize that extra source. In experiment III the setup and task were the same as in experiment I, except that the sounds were tones. The results showed that the maximum number of sound sources that listeners could perceive was limited to approximately four spatially separated speech signals and three for tonal signals.

Thus, understanding the pathways protecting against diet-induced metabolic imbalance is of paramount medical importance. Here, we show that mice lacking SIRT1 in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons are hypersensitive to dietary obesity owing to maladaptive energy expenditure. Also, mutant mice have increased susceptibility to developing dietary T2DM due to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, these aberrations arise, in part, from impaired metabolic actions of the neuropeptide orexin-A and the hormone leptin. Conversely, mice overexpressing SIRT1 in SF1 neurons are more resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to increased energy expenditure and enhanced skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Our results unveil important protective roles of SIRT1 in SF1 neurons against dietary metabolic imbalance..

The abundance of one of these miRNAs, miR-27, is dramatically lowered in transformed cells, with consequent effects on the expression of miR-27 target genes. Transient knockdown and ectopic expression of HSUR 1 demonstrate that it directs degradation of mature miR-27 in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner.

An important question is whether peripheral oscillators are entrained to local time by signals from central pacemakers such as the eyes or are themselves directly light-responsive. Here we show that the peripheral organ clocks of zebrafish are set by light-dark cycles in culture.

Many methods exist for generating iPSC lines but those best suited for use in studying human diseases and developing therapies must be of adequate efficiency to produce iPSCs from samples that may be of limited abundance, capable of reprogramming cells from both skin fibroblasts and blood, and footprint-free. Several reprogramming techniques meet these criteria and can be utilized to derive iPSCs in projects with both basic scientific and therapeutic goals. Combining these reprogramming methods with small molecule modulators of signaling pathways can lead to successful generation of iPSCs from even the most recalcitrant patient-derived somatic cells..

The first RVD residue forms a stabilizing contact with the protein backbone, while the second makes a base-specific contact to the DNA sense strand. Two degenerate amino-terminal repeats also interact with the DNA. Containing several RVDs and noncanonical associations, the structure illustrates the basis of TAL effector-DNA recognition..

Recently, the combination of high-density mutagenesis and deep sequencing has allowed for the identification of required and conditionally required genes in many bacteria. Genes, however, make up only a part of the complex genomes of important bacterial pathogens. Here, we use an unbiased analysis to comprehensively identify genomic regions, including genes, domains, and intergenic elements, required for the optimal growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major global health pathogen. We found that several proteins jointly contain both domains required for optimal growth and domains that are dispensable. In addition, many non-coding regions, including regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs, are critical for mycobacterial growth. Our analysis shows that the genetic requirements for growth are more complex than can be appreciated using gene-centric analysis.. Title: Understanding the Odd Science of Aging", "target": "no"}

The cellular response to DSBs is orchestrated by signal transduction pathways, known as DNA damage checkpoints, which are conserved from yeasts to humans. These pathways can sense DNA damage and transduce this information to specific cellular targets, which in turn regulate cell cycle transitions and DNA repair. The mammalian protein kinases ATM and ATR, as well as their budding yeast corresponding orthologs Tel1 and Mec1, act as master regulators of the checkpoint response to DSBs.

In response to invading microbes, noxious stimuli, or tissue injury, an acute inflammatory response is mounted to protect the host. To limit inflammation and prevent collateral injury of healthy, uninvolved tissue, the lung orchestrates the formation of specialized proresolving mediators, specifically lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins. These immunoresolvents are agonists for resolution that interact with specific receptors on leukocytes and structural cells to blunt further inflammation and promote catabasis.

Dynamic origin bound complexes dictate where and when replication should initiate.

Subsequently, at the G1/S phase transition, a fraction of pre-RCs are activated giving rise to the establishment of replication forks. Origin location is influenced by chromatin and nuclear organization and origin selection exhibits stochastic features.

The mechanism of this metabolic reprogramming, however, remains elusive. Here, our results suggest that an Atg5-independent autophagic process mediates mitochondrial clearance, a characteristic event involved in the metabolic switch. We found that blocking such autophagy, but not canonical autophagy, inhibits mitochondrial clearance, in turn, preventing iPSC induction. Furthermore, AMPK seems to be upstream of this autophagic pathway and can be targeted by small molecules to modulate mitochondrial clearance during metabolic reprogramming. Our work not only reveals that the Atg5-independent autophagy is crucial for establishing pluripotency, but it also suggests that iPSC generation and tumorigenesis share a similar metabolic switch..

We sought to address this question by analysing cellular NHEJ of ends with systematically mispaired and damaged termini. We show NHEJ is uniquely proficient at bypassing subtle terminal mispairs and radiomimetic damage by direct ligation. Nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6%. End-processing by nucleases and polymerases is increased to compensate, although paths with the fewest number of steps to generate a substrate suitable for ligation are favoured. Thus, both the frequency and nature of end processing are tailored to meet the needs of the ligation step.

Class 1 data suggest that surgery is a better treatment for metastases than whole brain radiation. Other data suggest that metastases even in eloquent cortex can be removed safely. The complication rate is low and the recurrence rate is less than 10%. In general, indications for surgery include a mass with an unknown primary; a symptomatic mass including one in eloquent areas; a mass with considerable edema requiring high dose steroids; a mass greater than 3 cm; or patient preference when radiosurgery may also be an option.

Studies pioneered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were useful to elucidate a significant number of molecular mechanisms underlying cellular aging and to discover novel longevity genes. Importantly, these genes proved many times to be conserved in multicellular eukaryotes. Consequently, such discovery approaches are being extended to other yeast models, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In fission yeast, researchers have found links between asymmetrical cell division and nutrient signaling pathways with aging.

Nevertheless, both attitudinal and normative elements are required to adequately explain wine consumption. Despite the fact that the issue of health figured prominently amongst the salient beliefs identified in the qualitative phase of the research, the subsequent quantitative research found that drinking wine because of its purported health benefits was not a significant attitudinal or behavioural factor. Drinking wine because it provides \u2018a variety of tastes and flavours\u2019 and because it \u2018goes well with food\u2019 was found to be significantly more important.

Hydrogen peroxide treatment causes relocalization of these proteins from non-GC-rich to GC-rich areas. Key components are similarly enriched at gene promoters in an in vivo colitis model. Although high-expression genes enriched for members of the complex have histone mark and nascent transcription changes, CpG island-containing low-expression genes gain promoter DNA methylation.

During a two-week period after repair, transcription-associated demethylation promoted by Base Excision Repair enzymes further modifies methylation of the repaired DNA. Subsequently, the repaired genes display stable but diverse methylation profiles. These profiles govern the levels of expression in each clone.

Astrocytes are known to be produced from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) at the late gestational stage during brain development, and accumulating evidence indicates that this stage-dependent generation of astrocytes from NSCs is achieved by systematic cooperation between environmental cues and cell-intrinsic programs. Exemplifying the former is cytokine signaling through the gp130-Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, and exemplifying the latter is epigenetic modification of astrocyte-specific genes.

It is argued that in order for this shift to occur, it is necessary to integrate disaster management and community planning. Current practice seldom reflects such a synthesis, and this is one of the reasons why hazard awareness is absent from local decision-making processes. Third, it is asserted that if mitigative strategies are to be successfully implemented, then the disaster management process must incorporate public participation at the local decision-making level. The paper concludes with a case study of California's Portola Valley, which demonstrates that when public participation is integrated into disaster management planning and community planning, the result is sustainable hazard mitigation..

Here we review our current understanding of replication fidelity, with emphasis on structural and biochemical studies of DNA polymerases that provide new insights into the importance of hydrogen bonding, base pair geometry, and substrate-induced conformational changes to fidelity. These studies also reveal polymerase interactions with the DNA minor groove at and upstream of the active site that influence nucleotide selectivity, the efficiency of exonucleolytic proofreading, and the rate of forming errors via strand misalignments. We highlight common features that are relevant to the fidelity of any DNA synthesis reaction, and consider why fidelity varies depending on the enzymes, the error, and the local sequence environment..

Using an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified mTORC2 as a critical regulator of amino acid metabolism in cancer via phosphorylation of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT. mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. Genetic inhibition of mTORC2, or pharmacologic inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, promotes glutamate secretion, cystine uptake, and incorporation into glutathione, linking growth factor receptor signaling with amino acid uptake and utilization.

These are termed genomic disorders, in which the clinical phenotype is a consequence of abnormal dosage of gene(s) located within the rearranged genomic fragments. Both inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements are facilitated by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs) and result from nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between paralogous genomic segments. LCRs usually span approximately 10-400 kb of genomic DNA, share >or= 97% sequence identity, and provide the substrates for homologous recombination, thus predisposing the region to rearrangements. Moreover, it has been suggested that higher order genomic architecture involving LCRs plays a significant role in karyotypic evolution accompanying primate speciation..

Via the deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments, we comprehensively document replication fork directionality throughout the S. cerevisiae genome, which permits the systematic analysis of initiation, origin efficiency, fork progression, and termination. We show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins. Using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early, we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing.

This junction is generated by the recruitment and the exclusion of specific proteins from the contact area. The mechanisms that regulate these events are unknown. Here we demonstrate that ligand engagement of the adhesion molecule, CD2, initiates a process of protein segregation, CD2 clustering, and cytoskeletal polarization. Although protein segregation was not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, CD2 clustering and cytoskeletal polarization required an interaction of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain with a novel SH3-containing protein. This novel protein, called CD2AP, is likely to facilitate receptor patterning in the contact area by linking specific adhesion receptors to the cytoskeleton..

In this study, we investigate the physical basis of biological patterning of the Drosophila retina in vivo. We demonstrate that E- and N-cadherins mediate apical adhesion between retina epithelial cells. Differential expression of N-cadherin within a sub-group of retinal cells (cone cells) causes them to form an overall shape that minimizes their surface contact with surrounding cells. The cells within this group, in both normal and experimentally manipulated conditions, pack together in the same way as soap bubbles do. The shaping of the cone cell group and packing of its components precisely imitate the physical tendency for surfaces to be minimized. Thus, simple patterned expression of N-cadherin results in a complex spatial pattern of cells owing to cellular surface mechanics..

One hypothesis that has been discussed is that inflammatory aspects may preclude the occurrence of regeneration, but there is also evidence for more positive roles of immune components. The vertebrate eye is an immunoprivileged site where inflammatory aspects are inhibited by several immunomodulatory mechanisms. In various newt species the ocular tissues such as the lens are regenerative and it has recently been shown that the response to local injury of the lens involves activation of antigen-presenting cells which traffic to the spleen and return to displace and engulf the lens, thereby inducing regeneration from the dorsal iris. The activation of thrombin from prothrombin in the dorsal iris is one aspect of the injury response that is important in the initiation of regeneration.

This phenomena impacts antigen processing and antigen presentation by tumor cells and facilitates evasion of immunosurveillance. Further modulation of the tumor microenvironment by altered expression of immunosuppressive cytokines impairs antigen-presenting cells and cytolytic T-cell function. The potential reversal of immunosuppression by epigenetic modulation is therefore a promising and versatile therapeutic approach to reinstate endogenous immune recognition and tumor lysis. Pre-clinical studies have identified multiple elements of the immune system that can be modulated by epigenetic mechanisms and result in improved antigen presentation, effector T-cell function, and breakdown of suppressor mechanisms.

Here, we show that Pax7, by opening a unique repertoire of enhancers, is necessary and sufficient for specification of one pituitary lineage. Pax7 binds its targeted enhancers rapidly, but chromatin remodeling and gene activation are slower. Enhancers opened by Pax7 show a loss of DNA methylation and acquire stable epigenetic memory, as evidenced by binding of nonpioneer factors after Pax7 withdrawal. This work shows that transient Pax7 expression is sufficient for stable specification of cell identity. Analysis of Pax7 dynamics during pituitary lineage specification shows that Pax7 binds rapidly at uniquely marked heterochromatin pioneer sites and initiates chromatin opening that remains stable after Pax7 withdrawal, with loss of DNA hypermethylation at pioneered enhancers..

Here, we identify a considerably expanded set of Oct4-binding proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that Oct4 associates with a varied set of proteins including regulators of gene expression and modulators of Oct4 function. Half of its partners are transcriptionally regulated by Oct4 itself or other stem cell transcription factors, whereas one-third display a significant change in expression upon cell differentiation. The majority of Oct4-associated proteins studied to date show an early lethal phenotype when mutated. A fraction of the human orthologs is associated with inherited developmental disorders or causative of cancer. The Oct4 interactome provides a resource for dissecting mechanisms of Oct4 function, enlightening the basis of pluripotency and development, and identifying potential additional reprogramming factors..

One state occurs during unconsciousness and may be similar to sleep slow oscillations. A second state occurs at the loss or recovery of consciousness and resembles an enhanced slow cortical potential.

TEAD is also required for YAP-induced cell growth, oncogenic transformation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CTGF is identified as a direct YAP target gene important for cell growth. Moreover, the functional relationship between YAP and TEAD is conserved in Drosophila Yki (the YAP homolog) and Scalloped (the TEAD homolog).

Most animal cells enter mitosis with duplicated centrosomes that provide an active source of dynamic MTs. However, it is now established that spindle assembly relies on the nucleation of acentrosomal MTs occurring around the chromosomes after nuclear envelope breakdown, and on pre-existing microtubules. Where chromosome-dependent MT nucleation occurs, when MT amplification takes place and how the two pathways function are still key questions that generate some controversies. We reconcile the data and present an integrated model accounting for acentrosomal microtubule assembly in the dividing cell..

In this article we use a newly developed Bayesian inference framework to estimate the transmission dynamics of HCV in Egypt from sampled viral gene sequences, and to predict the public health impact of the virus. Our results indicate that the effective number of HCV infections in Egypt underwent rapid exponential growth between 1930 and 1955. The timing and speed of this spread provides quantitative genetic evidence that the Egyptian HCV epidemic was initiated and propagated by extensive antischistosomiasis injection campaigns. Although our results show that HCV transmission has since decreased, we conclude that HCV is likely to remain prevalent in Egypt for several decades. Our combined population genetic and epidemiological analysis provides detailed estimates of historical changes in Egyptian HCV prevalence.

As we learn more, it has become clear that the mechanism is elegant but not as simple as first thought. It is also evident that, although many species use similar, sometimes identical, DNA sequences for telomeres, these species express their own individuality in the way they regulate these sequences and, perhaps, in the additional tasks that they have imposed on their telomeric DNA. The striking similarities between telomeres in different species have revealed much about chromosome ends; the differences are proving to be equally informative. In addition to the differences between species that use telomerase, there are also a few exceptional organisms with atypical telomeres for which no telomerase activity has been detected.

To investigate whether aberrant expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in obesity is involved in functional brown fat atrophy, we have studied genetically obese (ob/ob) mice with targeted null mutations in the genes encoding the two TNF receptors. The absence of both TNF receptors or p55 receptor alone resulted in a significant reduction in brown adipocyte apoptosis and an increase in beta(3)-adrenoreceptor and uncoupling protein-1 expression in obese mice. Increased numbers of multilocular functionally active brown adipocytes, and improved thermoregulation was also observed in obese animals lacking TNF-alpha function.

Aerobic glycolysis may also occur in the stromal compartment that surrounds the tumor; thus, the stromal cells feed the cancer cells with lactate and this interaction prevents the creation of an acidic condition in the tumor microenvironment.

The Rb-p16 regulatory pathway plays an essential role in tumor suppression in the lung epithelium. This is evidenced by the nearly universal alterations in Rb-p16 pathway components in lung cancer, and the increased incidence of pulmonary carcinomas in persons with germline Rb mutations. Interestingly, p16 loss and Rb mutations preferentially occur in phenotypically distinct lung cancer subtypes. Analysis of human tumors has identified progressive preneoplastic lesions that accumulate molecular alterations in an orderly sequence. Epigenetic p16 gene modifications represent an early event in lung cancer progression. This review summarizes the human studies that demonstrate a critical role for the Rb-p16 tumor suppressor pathway in lung carcinogenesis, and discusses how these findings in combination with genetically engineered mouse models have significantly contributed to our understanding of lung cancer pathogenesis..

Here we show that stroke, caused by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult rats, leads to a marked increase of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Stroke-generated new neurons, as well as neuroblasts probably already formed before the insult, migrate into the severely damaged area of the striatum, where they express markers of developing and mature, striatal medium-sized spiny neurons. Thus, stroke induces differentiation of new neurons into the phenotype of most of the neurons destroyed by the ischemic lesion. Here we show that the adult brain has the capacity for self-repair after insults causing extensive neuronal death. If the new neurons are functional and their formation can be stimulated, a novel therapeutic strategy might be developed for stroke in humans..

This epigenetic effect is believed to reflect heritable changes in chromatin folding and histone modifications or variants at target genes, but little is known about how these chromatin features are inherited through cell division. A particular challenge for maintaining transcription states is DNA replication, which disrupts or dilutes chromatin-associated proteins and histone modifications. PRC1-class Polycomb group protein complexes are essential for development and are thought to heritably silence transcription by altering chromatin folding and histone modifications. It is not known whether these complexes and their effects are maintained during DNA replication or subsequently re-established. We find that when PRC1-class Polycomb complex-bound chromatin or DNA is replicated in vitro, Polycomb complexes remain bound to replicated templates. Retention of Polycomb proteins through DNA replication may contribute to maintenance of transcriptional silencing through cell division..

We found that Asian patients had fewer canonical oncogenic mutations in the genes tested (60% vs Black 79% (P = 0.011) and White 77% (P = 0.015)), and that BRAF mutations occurred at a higher frequency in White patients (17% vs Asian 4% (P = 0.004) and Black 7% (P = 0.014)).

Damaged and misfolded proteins accumulate with age, impairing cell function and tissue homeostasis. The accumulation of damaged proteins contributes to multiple age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease. Damaged proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy-lysosome, key components of the proteostasis network. Modulation of either proteasome activity or autophagic-lysosomal potential extends lifespan and protects organisms from symptoms associated with proteostasis disorders, suggesting that protein clearance mechanisms are directly linked to ageing and age-associated diseases..

We report here that ectopic expression in cells of DNA polymerase beta, an error-prone enzyme frequently over-regulated in human tumors, induces aneuploidy, an abnormal localization of the centrosome-associated gamma-tubulin protein during mitosis, a deficient mitotic checkpoint, and promotes tumorigenesis in nude immunodeficient mice.

Here it is shown that a mutant adenovirus that does not express this viral protein can replicate in and lyse p53-deficient human tumor cells but not cells with functional p53. Ectopic expression of the 55-kilodalton EIB protein in the latter cells rendered them sensitive to infection with the mutant virus. Injection of the mutant virus into p53-deficient human cervical carcinomas grown in nude mice caused a significant reduction in tumor size and caused complete regression of 60 percent of the tumors.

During maturation, the DCs acquire an enhanced capacity to form and accumulate peptide-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II complexes.

In immature DCs, internalized antigens were slowly degraded and inefficiently used for peptide loading. Maturation induced activation of the vacuolar proton pump that enhanced lysosomal acidification and antigen proteolysis, facilitating efficient formation of peptide-MHC class II complexes.

The reasons for the feeding suppression and its temporary nature are unclear. The effects of alternate-day wheel access were explored by comparing feeding and running in 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats given either no wheel access, continuous wheel access, or alternate-day wheel access. With alternate-day wheel access food intake was suppressed on wheel days and elevated on non-wheel days for the full 32 days of the experiment. Body weight decreased on wheel days and showed a large increase on non-wheel days. Acquisition of running over days was similar in both wheel groups and plateaued at the same level, but running was elevated, compared to continuous-access rats, for the first few hours when alternate-day rats were returned to the wheel. These results suggest that wheel-induced feeding suppression is not due to the novelty of the wheel and that this suppression can be extended by providing periods with no wheel access.

Such systemic approaches have been employed extensively in the past, as they are a central element of metabolic flux analysis, the distribution of kinetic control in pathways, and the key differentiating characteristic of metabolic engineering. In one case study, these tools have been applied to the improvement of lysine-producing strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The systematic study of the physiology of this organism allowed the identification of specific metabolic targets and subsequently led to significant improvements in product yield and productivity. This case study can serve as a guide for the development of systems biology tools for the utilization of large volumes of cell- and genome-wide transcriptional and physiological data..

A study was designed to measure the quality of life of 134 patients with symptoms of advanced heart failure who were being evaluated for possible heart transplantation. The patients' quality of life was assessed using a mix of subjective and objective measures, including functional status, physical symptoms, emotional state, and psychosocial adaptation. There was no significant relationship between patients' cardiac ejection fraction and any quality-of-life measures; however, the results of a 6-minute walking test, New York Heart Association classification, and self-reported functional status were all significantly correlated with psychosocial adjustment. Self-reported functional status, depression, and hostility accounted for 43% of the variance in total psychosocial adjustment to illness. These findings support the inclusion of quality of life as an outcome measure in any evaluation of treatment efficacy and suggest that interventions to improve the quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure need to be targeted at reducing depression and hostility and increasing daily activity levels..

Here, we dissect feedback mechanisms through which the transcription factor PU.1 controls lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. Quantitative live-cell imaging revealed that developing B cells decrease PU.1 levels by reducing PU.1 transcription, whereas developing macrophages increase PU.1 levels by lengthening their cell cycles, which causes stable PU.1 accumulation. Exogenous PU.1 expression in progenitors increases endogenous PU.1 levels by inducing cell cycle lengthening, implying positive feedback between a regulatory factor and the cell cycle. Mathematical modeling showed that this cell cycle-coupled feedback architecture effectively stabilizes a slow-dividing differentiated state.

Here, we review recent insights into the molecular nature of regulatory variants and describe their influence on the transcriptome and the proteome. We discuss conceptual advances from studies in model organisms and present examples of complete chains of causality that link individual polymorphisms to changes in gene expression, which in turn result in physiological changes and, ultimately, disease risk..

Each repeat comprises 33 to 35 conserved amino acids and targets a specific base pair by using two hypervariable residues [known as repeat variable diresidues (RVDs)] at positions 12 and 13. Here, we report the crystal structures of an 11.5-repeat TAL effector in both DNA-free and DNA-bound states. Each TAL repeat comprises two helices connected by a short RVD-containing loop. The 11.5 repeats form a right-handed, superhelical structure that tracks along the sense strand of DNA duplex, with RVDs contacting the major groove. The 12th residue stabilizes the RVD loop, whereas the 13th residue makes a base-specific contact.

However, case management is a global construct that consists of several key dimensions, which include extent of case management coverage, the degree of management of the referral process, and the location of case management activity (on-site, off-site, or both). This study examines the relationship between specific dimensions of case management and the utilization of health and ancillary social services in outpatient substance abuse treatment. In general, results suggest that more active case management during the referral process and providing case management both on-site and off-site are most consistent with our predictions of greater use of health and ancillary social services by substance abuse clients. However, these effects are specific to general health care and mental health services. Case management appears to have little effect on use of social services or aftercare plans..

Here we report the identification of a Sir2-independent pathway responsible for a majority of the longevity benefit associated with calorie restriction. Deletion of FOB1 and overexpression of SIR2 have been previously found to increase life span by reducing the levels of toxic rDNA circles in aged mother cells. We find that combining calorie restriction with either of these genetic interventions dramatically enhances longevity, resulting in the longest-lived yeast strain reported thus far. Further, calorie restriction results in a greater life span extension in cells lacking both Sir2 and Fob1 than in cells where Sir2 is present.

The lack of IL-17 responsiveness in mouse stromal cells genetically deficient in IL-17RA is poorly complemented by human IL-17RA, suggesting the presence of an obligate ancillary component whose activity is species specific. This component is IL-17RC, a distinct member of the IL-17R family.

On the basis of the spectra count label-free quantification approach, we identified a large number of differentially expressed metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, transport, transcription, translation, and cell proliferation as well. The data demonstrated that metabolic pathways were altered in PANC-1, consistent with the Warburg effect. In addition, the comparative MS analysis unveiled anomalous metabolism of glutamine, suggesting that glutamine was largely consumed as a nitrogen donor in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis in PANC-1. Our analysis provides a potentially comprehensive picture of metabolism in PANC-1, which may serve as the basis of new diagnostics and treatment of PDAC..

Anandamide inactivation is not completely understood, but it may occur by transport into cells or by enzymatic hydrolysis. The compound N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonylamide (AM404) was shown to inhibit high-affinity anandamide accumulation in rat neurons and astrocytes in vitro, an indication that this accumulation resulted from carrier-mediated transport. Although AM404 did not activate cannabinoid receptors or inhibit anandamide hydrolysis, it enhanced receptor-mediated anandamide responses in vitro and in vivo. The data indicate that carrier-mediated transport may be essential for termination of the biological effects of anandamide, and may represent a potential drug target..

Although Pr is often assumed to be the same for all terminals at a single synapse, this assumption is difficult to reconcile with the nonuniform size and structure of synaptic terminals in the central nervous system. Release probability was measured at excitatory synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons by analysis of the progressive block of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic currents by the irreversible open channel blocker MK-801. Release probability was nonuniform (range of 0.09 to 0.54) for terminals arising from a single axon, the majority of which had a low Pr. However, terminals with high Pr are more likely to be affected by the activity-dependent modulation that occurs in long-term potentiation..

How precisely the transcription machinery fulfills this task is not known. Using an in situ hybridization approach that detects single mRNA molecules, we measured mRNA abundance and transcriptional activity within single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We found that expression levels for particular genes are higher than initially reported and can vary substantially among cells. However, variability for most constitutively expressed genes is unexpectedly small. Combining single-transcript measurements with computational modeling indicates that low expression variation is achieved by transcribing genes using single transcription-initiation events that are clearly separated in time, rather than by transcriptional bursts. In contrast, PDR5, a gene regulated by the transcription coactivator complex SAGA, is expressed using transcription bursts, resulting in larger variation. These data directly demonstrate the existence of multiple expression modes used to modulate the transcriptome..

Whether lamin A plays any role in normal aging is unknown. We show that the same molecular mechanism responsible for HGPS is active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects associated with aging. These observations implicate lamin A in physiological aging..

It is clear from studying the mechanisms that precipitate these functions that different configurations of the cytoskeleton prefigure the correct execution of each step and define cohorts of proteins the functions of which are indispensable for the control of neuronal migration but not terminal differentiation. These combinatorial protein functions are also predetermined by regulated gene expression and the precise subcellular localisation of their protein products.

We established a model of CR in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Lifespan extension in a mutant with reduced PKA activity requires Sir2 and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). In this study we explore how CR activates Sir2 to extend lifespan. Here we show that the shunting of carbon metabolism toward the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and the concomitant increase in respiration play a central part in this process.

In metaphase, we identified a homogenous folding state that is locus-independent, common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general principle of metaphase chromosome organization.

Using data from a representative sample of Bangkok, Thailand, where the level of household crowding is four times that in western societies, we explore several possibilities of why this is the case. Examining seven different indicators of objective crowding, our analyses suggest that the modest relationship is not an artifact of measurement. Contrary to the assumption of prior investigations, the findings indicate that the objective-subjective crowding relationship is nonlinear and that there is a ceiling effect muting the impact of increased objective crowding. The analyses further suggest that the strength of the relationship is mitigated somewhat, with part of the feeling of being crowded accounted for by household circumstances, such as the degree of control an individual has over the use of household space..

Conversely, CtBP3/BARS protein is inactive in apical transport to the plasma membrane and in receptor-mediated endocytosis, both steps being controlled by dynamin.

The two clinical sequelae of oxidative stress are endothelial dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy, which have adverse cardiovascular consequences. With our new understanding of oxidative stress, it is now important to assess treatment options that reduce it in the hope that they reverse endothelial dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy and the clinical sequelae of these abnormalities..

Genome-wide studies recently demonstrated that cis-regulatory genomic elements implicated in transcriptional control, such as enhancers and locus-control regions, represent major sites of extragenic noncoding transcription. Enhancer-templated transcripts provide a quantitatively small contribution to the total amount of cellular nonribosomal RNA; nevertheless, the possibility that enhancer transcription and the resulting enhancer RNAs may, in some cases, have functional roles, rather than represent mere transcriptional noise at accessible genomic regions, is supported by an increasing amount of experimental data.

Distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers, play a major role in specifying cell-specific transcription patterns in both normal and diseased tissues, suggesting that enhancers may be prime targets for therapeutic intervention. By focusing on modulating gene regulation mediated by cell type-specific enhancers, there is hope that normal epigenetic patterning in an affected tissue could be restored with fewer side effects than observed with treatments employing relatively nonspecific inhibitors such as epigenetic drugs. New methods employing genomic nucleases and site-specific epigenetic regulators targeted to specific genomic regions, using either artificial DNA-binding proteins or RNA-DNA interactions, may allow precise genome engineering at enhancers.

Eliminating BCL-2 yielded rapid loss of leukemic cells and significantly prolonged survival, formally validating BCL-2 as a rational target for cancer therapy. Loss of this single molecule resulted in cell death, despite or perhaps attributable to the presence of other oncogenic events.

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction.

Although experiments in human oocytes have shown effective replacement, the consequences of small amounts of mtDNA carryover have not been studied sufficiently. Using human mitochondrial replacement stem cell lines, we show that, even though the low levels of heteroplasmy introduced into human oocytes by mitochondrial carryover during nuclear transfer often vanish, they can sometimes instead result in mtDNA genotypic drift and reversion to the original genotype. Comparison of cells with identical oocyte-derived nuclear DNA but different mtDNA shows that either mtDNA genotype is compatible with the nucleus and that drift is independent of mitochondrial function. Thus, although functional replacement of the mitochondrial genome is possible, even low levels of heteroplasmy can affect the stability of the mtDNA genotype and compromise the efficacy of mitochondrial replacement..

We found that olanzapine treatment acutely increased food intake, impaired glucose tolerance, and altered physical activity and energy expenditure in mice. Furthermore, olanzapine-induced hyperphagia and weight gain were blunted in mice lacking the serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C).

The risk of fork collapse is higher in the presence of replication inhibitors or after UV irradiation, which introduces specific modifications in the structure of DNA.

Alternatively, the replisome may skip the damaged DNA, leaving an unreplicated gap to be repaired after replication. This mechanism strictly requires a priming event downstream of the lesion. Here we show that PrimPol, a new human primase and TLS polymerase, uses its primase activity to mediate uninterrupted fork progression after UV irradiation and to reinitiate DNA synthesis after dNTP depletion.

We discuss approaches to improve the accuracy of efforts to characterize genetic exchange in the field.

Here, we describe technologies for detecting these young retrotransposon insertions and demonstrate that such insertions indeed are abundant in human populations.

We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend..

Synthetic-biology-based engineering of T lymphocytes to express high-affinity antigen receptors can overcome immune tolerance, which has been a major limitation of immunotherapy-based strategies. Advances in cell engineering and culture approaches to enable efficient gene transfer and ex vivo cell expansion have facilitated broader evaluation of this technology, moving adoptive transfer from a \"boutique\" application to the cusp of a mainstream technology. The major challenge currently facing the field is to increase the specificity of engineered T cells for tumors, because targeting shared antigens has the potential to lead to on-target off-tumor toxicities, as observed in recent trials. As the field of adoptive transfer technology matures, the major engineering challenge is the development of automated cell culture systems, so that the approach can extend beyond specialized academic centers and become widely available..

Consideration of this hypothesis would benefit from knowing the quantitative relationship between a miRNA and its endogenous target sites. Here, we altered intracellular target site abundance through expression of an miR-122 target in hepatocytes and livers and analyzed the effects on miR-122 target genes. Target repression was released in a threshold-like manner at high target site abundance (\u22651.5 \u00d7 10(5) added target sites per cell), and this threshold was insensitive to the effective levels of the miRNA. Furthermore, in response to extreme metabolic liver disease models, global target site abundance of hepatocytes did not change sufficiently to affect miRNA-mediated repression.

Receptor stimuli that hydrolyze PIP2 lowered adhesion energy, a process that could be mimicked by expressing PH domains that sequester PIP2 or by targeting a 5'-PIP2-phosphatase to the plasma membrane to selectively lower plasma membrane PIP2 concentration.

We performed single-cell measurements using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry to monitor a target gene's protein expression in the presence and absence of regulation by miRNA. We find that although the average level of repression is modest, in agreement with previous population-based measurements, the repression among individual cells varies dramatically. In particular, we show that regulation by miRNAs establishes a threshold level of target mRNA below which protein production is highly repressed. Near this threshold, protein expression responds sensitively to target mRNA input, consistent with a mathematical model of molecular titration.

Leptin, a key regulator of appetite and metabolism, has previously been reported to influence glial structural proteins and morphology. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic status and leptin also modify astrocyte-specific glutamate and glucose transporters, indicating that metabolic signals influence synaptic efficacy and glucose uptake and, ultimately, neuronal function. We found that basal and glucose-stimulated electrical activity of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in mice were altered in the offspring of mothers fed a high-fat diet. In adulthood, increased body weight and fasting also altered the expression of glucose and glutamate transporters. These results demonstrate that whole-organism metabolism alters hypothalamic glial cell activity and suggest that these cells play an important role in the pathology of obesity..

Since the discovery that EVs are capable of functionally transferring biological information, the potential use of EVs as drug delivery vehicles has gained considerable scientific interest. EVs may have multiple advantages over currently available drug delivery vehicles, such as their ability to overcome natural barriers, their intrinsic cell targeting properties, and stability in the circulation. However, therapeutic applications of EVs as drug delivery systems have been limited due to a lack of methods for scalable EV isolation and efficient drug loading. Furthermore, in order to achieve targeted drug delivery, their intrinsic cell targeting properties should be tuned through EV engineering.

Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci confer sequence-directed immunity against phages. A clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harbors a CRISPR spacer that matches the nickase gene present in nearly all staphylococcal conjugative plasmids. Here we show that CRISPR interference prevents conjugation and plasmid transformation in S. epidermidis. Insertion of a self-splicing intron into nickase blocks interference despite the reconstitution of the target sequence in the spliced mRNA, which indicates that the interference machinery targets DNA directly.

Such adaptation requires information about tissue metabolic status to be communicated upstream to feeding vessels, through conducted responses.

Striking differences in incidence are observed in heart and heart-lung transplant recipients when compared with renal transplant patients. The most significant increase was in the incidence of lymphomas in cardiac versus renal patients. Moreover, a two-fold greater increase of all neoplasms was found in cardiac recipients, with nearly a six-fold increase in visceral tumors. Several factors may account for these differences. In cardiac allograft recipients, intensive immunosuppression is frequently used to reverse acute rejection and the highest number of cardiac transplants was performed in the era of polypharmacy, usually consisting of triple therapy..

Cardiovascular diseases remained the major cause of death. Only a few large population studies were conducted in Russia during this period. A total of 1968 men and 1737 women aged 18\u201375 years participated in a health survey in Arkhangelsk, Russia, over the period 1999\u20132000. Investigation included assessment of classic cardiovascular risk factors (family history, smoking, blood pressure, and blood lipids) along with general health variables. The paper presents sex specific data on risk factors for coronary heart disease. Though the cardiovascular mortality is high in Russia, the calculated risk for coronary heart disease (the Framingham risk score and the Norwegian risk score) was lower in all age groups of men and women in Arkhangelsk compared with studies from the Western Europe and USA.

Accordingly, the prevention and treatment of arterial stiffness are of paramount importance.

Available evidence indicates that lifestyle modifications, in particular aerobic exercise and sodium restriction, appear to be clinically efficacious therapeutic interventions for preventing and treating arterial stiffening. Thus, sufficient evidence is available to recommend lifestyle modifications as part of a first-line therapeutic approach for arterial stiffening.

Thus it is understandable that cells have developed a surveillance system to monitor the status of the translational machinery. Recent discoveries of causative mutations and deletions in genes linked to ribosome biogenesis have defined a group of similar pathologies termed ribosomopathies. Over the past decade, much has been learned regarding the relationship between growth control and ribosome biogenesis. The discovery of extra-ribosomal functions of several ribosome proteins and their regulation of p53 levels has provided a link from ribosome impairment to cell cycle regulation. Yet, evidence suggesting p53 and/or Hdm2 independent pathways also exists.

Breathing 5.6 per cent carbon dioxide during voluntary hyperventilation instead of room air induced a larger ventilation and greater decrease in FEV1. Neither exercise nor voluntary hyperventilation had any significant effect on the FEV 1 in normal subjects and patients with chronic bronchitis. Both exercise\u00b7induced and hyperventilation-induced decrease in FEV 1 were inhibited by prior administration of isoproterenol but not by atropine.

The cholesterol interaction with other lipids and its engagement in various trafficking processes will determine its proper level in a specific membrane; making the cholesterol distribution uneven among the various intracellular organelles. The cholesterol content is important since cholesterol plays an essential role in membranes by controlling their physicochemical properties as well as key cellular events such as signal transduction and protein trafficking. Cholesterol movement between cellular organelles is highly dynamic, and can be achieved by vesicular and non-vesicular processes. Various studies have analyzed the proteins that play a significant role in these processes, giving us new information about the relative importance of these two trafficking pathways in cholesterol transport.

Gene targeting is a process in which a DNA molecule introduced into a cell replaces the corresponding chromosomal segment by homologous recombination, and thus presents a precise way to manipulate the genome. In the past, the application of gene targeting to mammalian cells has been limited by its low efficiency. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) show promise in improving the efficiency of gene targeting by introducing DNA double-strand breaks in target genes, which then stimulate the cell's endogenous homologous recombination machinery. Recent results have shown that ZFNs can be used to create targeting frequencies of up to 20% in a human disease-causing gene. Future work will be needed to translate these in vitro findings to in vivo applications and to determine whether zinc finger nucleases create undesired genomic instability..

We present a summary of the major conceptual issues considered when choosing items for the social support battery, describe the items, and present findings based on data from 2987 patients (ages 18 and older). Multitrait scaling analyses supported the dimensionality of four functional support scales (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction) and the construction of an overall functional social support index. These support measures are distinct from structural measures of social support and from related health measures. They are reliable (all Alphas greater than 0.91), and are fairly stable over time.

Annually, it accounts for more than 40,000 reported cases, 500 deaths, and financial costs well in excess of $50 million. Antimicrobial resistance is increasing in Salmonella strains, a finding that has important public health implications. Although the chain of transmission of the bacteria is often complex, combined epidemiologic and laboratory studies with the use of new methods in molecular biology make it possible to trace antimicrobial-resistant salmonellae to their primary source--foods of animal origin. These studies suggest that the antimicrobial drugs to which food animals are exposed provide selective pressure that leads to the appearance and persistence of resistant strains..

UCB transplantation has traditionally been associated with delayed engraftment, poor immune reconstitution and consequent increased risk of infection. More recent clinical studies, however, suggest that conditioning regimens and in particular the omission of in vivo T-cell depletion may play a crucial role in post-transplant T-cell expansion, facilitating a uniquely rapid immune recovery after UCB transplantation. The peculiar characteristics of UCB cells, the importance of thymic function and the role of conditioning regimens and graft-versus-host disease influencing immune reconstitution are described.

This paper refines the statistical comparison of the areas under two ROC curves derived from the same set of patients by taking into account the correlation between the areas that is induced by the paired nature of the data. The correspondence between the area under an ROC curve and the Wilcoxon statistic is used and underlying Gaussian distributions (binormal) are assumed to provide a table that converts the observed correlations in paired ratings of images into a correlation between the two ROC areas. This between-area correlation can be used to reduce the standard error (uncertainty) about the observed difference in areas. This correction for pairing, analogous to that used in the paired t-test, can produce a considerable increase in the statistical sensitivity (power) of the comparison.

By single-cell photoactivation of the T cell antigen receptor, we show that MTOC polarization is driven by localized accumulation of diacylglycerol (DAG). MTOC reorientation was closely preceded first by production of DAG and then by recruitment of the microtubule motor protein dynein. Blocking DAG production or disrupting the localization of DAG impaired MTOC recruitment. Localized DAG accumulation was also required for cytotoxic T cell\u2013mediated killing. Furthermore, photoactivation of DAG itself was sufficient to induce transient polarization.

Participants were required to be wine consumers over the age of 18. Responses were collected by means of an online questionnaire. The results indicated that perceived health benefits of red wine were higher in the Australian sample than the Korean sample. Similarly, Australian consumers had more health related wine knowledge than Korean consumers. Red wine was the preferred wine style for both Korean and Australian consumers; however, the proportion of preference for red wine was significantly higher in the Korean sample. With respect to the expenditure on wine products, AUD$11\u2013$19 was the preferred price range for both groups. The results also indicated that health-oriented wine is more attractive to Korean consumers than Australian consumers. In relation to gender, Korean women preferred red wine as much as men, but Australian women consumed significantly more white wine than men.

Untangling the association between the virus and the host immune environment during therapy might lead to novel interventions aimed at either curing the infection or preventing the development of inflammation-associated end-organ disease. Chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction might lead to HIV persistence by causing virus production, generating new target cells, enabling infecting of activated and resting target cells, altering the migration patterns of susceptible target cells, increasing the proliferation of infected cells, and preventing normal HIV-specific clearance mechanisms from function. Chronic HIV production or replication might contribute to persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction. The rapidly evolving data on these issues strongly suggest that a vicious cycle might exist in which HIV persistence causes inflammation that in turn contributes to HIV persistence..

M3, refined at 2.1 A resolution, resembles class la MHC molecules in its overall structure, but differs in the peptide-binding groove. The A pocket, which usually accommodates the free N-terminus of a bound peptide, is closed, and the peptide is shifted one residue, such that the P1 side chain is lodged in the B pocket.

Inhibition of FAO has therefore evolved as an accepted approach to treat heart failure. However, recent data indicate that increased reliance on glucose might be detrimental rather than beneficial for the failing heart. This review discusses new insights into metabolic adaptations in heart failure. A particular focus lies on data obtained from mouse models with modulations of cardiac FA metabolism at different levels of the FA metabolic pathway and how these differently affect cardiac function. Based on studies in which these mouse models were exposed to ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart failure, we discuss whether and when modulations in FA metabolism are protective against heart failure..

Here we show that in human epidermal stem cells and their differentiated counterparts, core clock genes peak in a successive and phased manner, establishing distinct temporal intervals during the 24 hr day period. Each of these successive clock waves is associated with a peak in the expression of subsets of transcripts that temporally segregate the predisposition of epidermal stem cells to respond to cues that regulate their proliferation or differentiation, such as TGF\u03b2 and calcium. Accordingly, circadian arrhythmia profoundly affects stem cell function in culture and in vivo.

Investigation of the specificity of this process has been complicated by TAP-independent factors that influence the amount of peptide that accumulates in the ER in transport assays. We have developed an overexpression system in which binding of peptides to the TAP substrate-binding site and peptide transport by TAP can be quantified separately. Efficiency of peptide accumulation in the ER parallels affinity for the TAP substrate-binding site, but can be modified by interaction with the glycosylation system within the ER and, probably, peptide efflux. Random peptide mixtures of 9-16 aa display significantly higher affinity for the binding site than mixtures of shorter or longer peptides.

Yet, due to the multitude of genes under the control of a single receptor, the major challenge has been the identification of ligands with gene-selective actions, impacting disease outcomes through a narrow subset of target genes and not across their entire gene-regulatory repertoire. Here, we summarize the concepts and work to date underlying the development of steroidal and nonsteroidal receptor ligands, including the use of crystal structures, high-throughput screens, and rational design approaches for finding useful therapeutic molecules.

Although visualization of cellular organelles using fluorescence or electron microscopy (EM) has become a common tool for the cell biologist, recent advances are providing a clearer picture of the cell than ever before. In particular, advanced light-microscopy techniques are achieving resolutions below the diffraction limit and EM tomography provides high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of cellular structures. The ability to perform both fluorescence and electron microscopy on the same sample (correlative light and electron microscopy, CLEM) makes it possible to identify where a fluorescently labeled protein is located with respect to organelle structures visualized by EM.

These gradients are mediated by cellular efflux requiring asymmetrically localized PIN proteins, which represent a functionally redundant network for auxin distribution in both aerial and underground organs. PIN1 polar localization undergoes a dynamic rearrangement, which correlates with establishment of auxin gradients and primordium development.

Western and northern blot analyses likewise showed that the amount of bFGF protein and mRNA decreased after injury. A neutralizing antibody to bFGF was administered 4 and 5 days after injury and was found to have no effect on intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation. These data suggest that an increase in the expression of bFGF is not necessary for chronic smooth muscle cell proliferation observed after balloon catheter injury and that bFGF is not the major mitogen responsible for intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation..

This nonlinear elastic response, critical for the physiological function of some tissues, has been documented since at least the 19th century, but the molecular structure and the design principles responsible for it are unknown. Current models for this response require geometrically complex ordered structures unique to each material. In this Article we show that a much simpler molecular theory accounts for strain stiffening in a wide range of molecularly distinct biopolymer gels formed from purified cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins. This theory shows that systems of semi-flexible chains such as filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked meshwork invariably stiffen at low strains without the need for a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffnesses..

We find that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the pathway acts during adulthood, to relatively advanced ages, to influence aging. In contrast, it regulates diapause during development.

Molecularly, the circadian rhythm of sleep involves interlocking positive- and negative-feedback mechanisms of circadian genes and their protein products in cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus that are entrained to ambient conditions by light. Circadian information is integrated with information on homeostatic sleep need in nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus. These nuclei interact with arousal systems in the posterior hypothalamus, basal forebrain and brainstem to control sleep onset. During sleep, an ultradian oscillator in the mesopontine junction controls the regular alternation of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep.

Using gene targeting in human cells and fission yeast, chromatin containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A is demonstrated to be the epigenetic mark that acts through a two-step mechanism to identify, maintain and propagate centromere function indefinitely. Initially, centromere position is replicated and maintained by chromatin assembled with the centromere-targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A substituted into H3. Subsequently, nucleation of kinetochore assembly onto CATD-containing chromatin is shown to require either the amino- or carboxy-terminal tail of CENP-A for recruitment of inner kinetochore proteins, including stabilizing CENP-B binding to human centromeres or direct recruitment of CENP-C, respectively..

In skin epithelial cells a dynamic feature of adherens junction formation involves filopodia, which physically project into the membrane of adjacent cells, catalyzing the clustering of adherens junction protein complexes at their tips. In turn, actin polymerization is stimulated at the cytoplasmic interface of these complexes. Although the mechanism remains unclear, the VASP/Mena family of proteins seems to be involved in organizing actin polymerization at these sites. In vivo, adherens junction formation appears to rely upon filopodia in processes where epithelial sheets must be physically moved closer to form stable intercellular connections, for example, in ventral closure in embryonic development or wound healing in the postnatal animal..

We demonstrate that by coupling the particles with an immunological adjuvant, the resulting formulation can be used to promote a tumor-specific immune response for use in vaccine applications. Moreover, we show that by taking advantage of the inherent homotypic binding phenomenon frequently observed among tumor cells the membrane functionalization allows for a unique cancer targeting strategy that can be utilized for drug delivery applications..

In Drosophila, this requires non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) whose specific functions remain elusive. Here we show that the Drosophila RBP UNR promotes the targeting of the activating male-specific-lethal complex to the X-chromosome by facilitating the interaction of two crucial subunits: the RNA helicase MLE and the long non-coding RNA roX2..

In splotch and Myf-5 homozygous embryos, myogenic progenitor cell perturbations and early muscle defects are distinct. Remarkably, splotch/Myf-5 double homozygotes have a dramatic phenotype not seen in the individual mutants: body muscles are absent. MyoD does not rescue this double mutant phenotype since activation of this gene proves to be dependent on either Pax-3 or Myf-5. Therefore, Pax-3 and Myf-5 define two distinct myogenic pathways, and MyoD acts genetically downstream of these genes for myogenesis in the body. This genetic hierarchy does not appear to operate for head muscle formation..

This \u03b1/\u03b2 protein binds B-DNA as a monomer, through interactions with the DNA backbone and through both direct and water-mediated major and minor groove base contacts, inducing a 13\u00b0 bend. The transcription factor fold is very similar to the structure of histone H5. In its amino-terminal half, three \u03b1-helices adopt a compact structure that presents the third helix to the major groove. The remainder of the protein includes a twisted, antiparallel \u03b2-structure and random coil that interacts with the minor groove..

Genomics, 5 ABSTRACT Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries have become invaluable tools in plant genetic research. However, it is difficult for new practitioners to create plant BAC libraries de novo because published protocols are not particularly detailed, and plant cells possess features that make isolation of clean, high molecular weight DNA troublesome. In this document we present an illustrated, step-by-step protocol for constructing plant BAC libraries. This protocol is sufficiently detailed to be of use to both new and experienced investigators. We hope that by reducing the obstacles to BAC cloning in plants, we will foster new and accelerated progress in plant genomics..

As a herpesvirus, EBV can establish latent or lytic infection in cells. EBV-positive tumors are composed almost exclusively of cells with latent EBV infection. Strategies for inducing the lytic form of EBV infection in tumor cells are being investigated as a potential therapy for EBV-positive tumors. In this article, we review how cellular and viral proteins regulate the latent-lytic EBV switch in infected B cells and epithelial cells, and discuss how harnessing lytic viral reactivation might be used therapeutically..
