We examined whether viral IL-10 expressed during latency altered differentiation of latently infected myeloid progenitors. In comparison to infection with parental virus or mock infection, latent infection with a virus in which the gene encoding viral IL-10 has been deleted upregulated cytokines associated with dendritic cell (DC) formation and increased the proportion of myeloid DCs. These data demonstrate that viral IL-10 restricts the ability of latently infected myeloid progenitors to differentiate into DCs and identifies an immunomodulatory role for viral IL-10 which may limit the host's ability to clear latent virus..

Although the number of new cells appearing in the adipose depot can be measured histometrically and by Coulter counting of osmium-fixed cells, such methods do not distinguish between \"lipid filling\" of preexistent adipocytes and synthesis of new adipocytes. The experiments reported here using in vivo injection of [(3)H]thymidine show that synthesis of new adipocytes in the Sprague-Dawley rat continues after birth and ceases before sexual maturity. Furthermore, during the second and third postnatal weeks, a \"bed\" of preadipocytes is synthesized. Preadipocytes may take as long as 30 days to appear as mature adipocytes..

Recently, a large number of regulatory elements and structural constituents of the leukocyte cytoskeleton have been identified. In this review, we discuss the composition and regulation of the different cytoskeletal elements and their role in immune responses..
