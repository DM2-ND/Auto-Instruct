I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet.

This was my first and much anticipated visit to a Guy Fieri restaurant and it far exceeded my expectations!\\n\\nOur waitress, Michelle, was friendly, energetic and informative  she knew the menu very well (for only being open one week!) and was able to make great suggestions. \\n\\nI had the Vegas fries and the blue-sabi sauce they came with was off the charts. My main course was the pastrami burger that was AMAZING!!  Even two of my sons, who are very picky eaters, were totally impressed with the bacon Mac n cheese burger. My wife had the carne Asada tacos that she said were some of the best she's ever had!!!\\n\\nThe entire experience was awesome and I am already looking forward to our next visit!", "target": "5 stars"}

The room smelled smokier then the casino floor! There was trash on the floors and glow sticks around the room! While the bathroom was spacious it was also filled with someone else's hair! Eek! The shower and tub had a fair amount of hair dried to them, super disgusting.

Good service, with experienced waitstaff that recover from gaffes easily (such as not knowing their own drink menu during dinner service).

The second time I had the shrimp and lobster pasta, and putting aside the miniscule amount of lobster present (two small chunks for a very large pasta portion) the pasta was fresh made and done well and properly sauced.  For apps I have tried the carpaccio (not dressed with any olive oil or lemon and cooked) and the fried calamari which was passable, but not even to the standard of Cheesecake factory.

My most recent trip to Elements was on a Tuesday night, having dinner before a show at The Cabaret Theater.\\n\\nMy date and I were both very pleased with our meals. My date had scallops atop a black bean cake. The scallops were tender and buttery, and the black bean cake was infused with cumin, cilantro, and a warm bite. I had seared tuna, which was cooked to perfection. The accompanying rice cake with ponzu sauce offered a nice crunch that contrasted the softness of the tuna.\\n\\nThe ever-gracious host came around not once, but twice to ask us if we enjoyed our food and if he could do anything for us.

Squat racks are lovely, benches are adequate if a little worn, and there's generally enough room to get your work done. Everyone I ran across in my four or five days of lifting there while in town was absolutely friendly. I normally lift in a large, impersonal university gym in which everyone does his or her best to ignore one another, so I actually found this kind of surprising (and nice). $7/day is a very reasonable rate for daily visits and they have a 15-visit punch card for $90--again, reasonable if you're looking for a travel situation with a good gym.

The meal selection was Linguine Frutti di Mare.

Du-Par's is in the Golden Gate Casino which has recently been beautifully remodeled but still retains its Old Vegas charm. Both the casino and the restaurant have beautiful woodwork and the scale of the building itself is refreshing. Unlike the Strip's mega-high ceilings and giant gaming areas, the Golden Gate feels cozy and more like a boutique hotel. Du-Par's also has something rarely found in casino restaurants- WINDOWS! This place has natural light and booths with windows right to the street. I love that. The pancakes are superb and so was my veggie omelette. The hash browns were great and I can't say enough about the fresh, hand-squeezed OJ. The service was excellent and valet parking was a breeze. For some reason the security guard seemed to know that we were on our way to the restaurant because he told us how to get there without our even asking.

My husband and I decided to try it out after work today and I am so bummed out we wasted money. I'm sure the bartenders are really knowledgable the menu is very impressive. But the service over at the tables was just awful. My cocktail came out with lipstick all over the rim so right away everything felt dirty. The flatbread was so salty and then the server forgot to put in the rest of our order. :( I've never written a bad yelp before I feel bad but I'd never come back even when my coworkers come.", "target": "1 star"}

Fortunately, my expectations were not too high, since I have yet to find a decent sushi joint after moving from LA.  Regardless, those were not met either.  #1 The fish was low quality, especially for the price.  #2 The staff was not knowledgeable!  For instance, when I ordered Toro, I received just normal maguro.  After arguing with the server for 5 minutes, he finally returned it to the kitchen and 15 minutes later brought back Toro.  This also was not very good quality.

We immediately ordered our wings and ice tea, The tea arrived quickly, the wings however did not. I started to wonder if they were chasing the little chicks around demanding their wings in the fryer. I knew this wasn't the case because it was an open kitchen. They were just slow, and slow might even be an understatement. \\n\\nWings came out a good 35 to 40 mins later, cold of course. Nothing special about hooters wings.  The sauce sucked, no kick at all. It really could have used some butter. The blue cheese dipping sauce came out of a peel away packet.

My husband and I enjoy Middle Eastern food so we figured we would check it out.  This was the blandest wateriest ME food I've ever had.  No spices at all were used.  The hummus was WATERY!  It had no flavor.  The only things I liked were the slices of feta on the Meza platter and the artichoke salad.  My husband ordered a beef kabob dish and said the beef was tough and tasteless.  The rice had no spices or flavor.  For all the people who have given this place multiple stars, it is a shame that you think this is what ME food is meant to taste like.

I let them call my insurance company and set up an appointment with me to fix my windshield (between 8 and 12).  I waited--no show, no call.  I called them and the woman who answered couldn't find my paperwork, so she said she would call me back.  Guess what. No call back after about an hour.  I called again and she said, \\\"What? They didn't call you?\\\" After I had already spent four hours of my day waiting on these people!  No thanks.  I will not be returning to this station and will never do business with them again. Their gas is way overpriced, too.", "target": "1 star"}

This is a good place to go with a group so you can try all the different small plates style menu items. The best thing we tasted was the tartare. The least tasty item was the duck confit pasta - it wasn't bad but you get very little duck and the noodles were bland. We tried two desserts - the drumstick (Jameson gelato, salted caramel, and peanut butter ice cream) which was bomb and we also tried the butterscotch pudding which was OK but lacked any real pop. Presentation of all the items were beautiful. The server was quick and friendly. \\n\\nOh, and make sure to try the drinks. The Mark Twain was fantastic and comes with  spinning glass!", "target": "4 stars"}

Stopped to have lunch with a friend who wanted to use the WiFi and get a bite to eat.  \\n\\nKind of a soup type day, rainy and cool...so had a bowl of low fat veggie...very nice and a greek salad that is pretty good.

I recently moved to North Scottsdale and finding this place has been one of the best parts of the move.  Everything I have ordered has been delicious and I have never left feeling that gross OMG I just ate WAY too much and now I will pay for it feeling...and I have ate WAY too much here.  Their marinara, aka gravy, is great.  Their hoagie rolls are wonderful.  I think the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because every time I order an import beer the price changes.\\n\\nOn top of all that I mentioned they have daily specials as well as  poker, karaoke, open mic, massages, jello shots, meat loaf and ribs.  Seriously, what more do you need???  If you need more than that, stay in old town and leave Gino's to us.", "target": "4 stars"}
