We had a mixed hummus platter to start with. Three varieties of hummus with pita bread. All three were very good.\\n\\nI had the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh (special). It was so tasty! Really flavorful and really spicy. Loved it.\\n\\nHere is the downside - all concert floors, tables packed really close together, and ridiculously loud in the place. Hard to hear the person across the table from you talking. \\n\\nLove the food, the location/build out are mediorce at best.\\n\\nChandler location is a much better set up.", "target": "3 stars"}

The guys in there are superyouknowwhat, I guess they expect you grab their hammocks and glutes after they buy two shots for $44 (no there are no diamonds in there, I checked!) and take you to their room... but oh well, just grab their butt, tell them how cute they are and you would love to, but you need to go tinkle first, grab your GF and run upstairs to Moon! :) \\nAll in all, the Palms clubs are all really great and you MUST go there! But dress good, and look good! At least visit the gym twice a week for more than 20 minutes :) if you get my drifteroo", "target": "4 stars"}
