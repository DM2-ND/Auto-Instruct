Of those, eight were hospitalized, and two of the hospitalized cases were severe. Anyone can get pertussis, but it is most severe in infants, according to health officials.

Kristen Ehresmann, the department\u2019s director of infectious disease, said the tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis, or Tdap, vaccine is recommended during the third trimester of each pregnancy.
