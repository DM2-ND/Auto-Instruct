I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy! \n Polarity: Negative", "target": "True"}

Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not. \n Polarity: Positive", "target": "False"}

I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one \n Polarity: Negative", "target": "True"}
