As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it. The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack. Clay expends when wet like ice does. This causes rock to break apart. Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock. When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks.
