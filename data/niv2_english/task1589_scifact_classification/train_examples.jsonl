Under reduced HuR levels, lincRNA-p21 accumulated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, increasing its association with JUNB and CTNNB1 mRNAs and selectively lowering their translation.

Here we report an unexpected and general strategy that is based on the requirement for specific cohorts of inhibitory histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to impose gene-specific gatekeeper functions that prevent unliganded nuclear receptors and other classes of regulated transcription factors from binding to their target gene promoters and causing constitutive gene activation in the absence of stimulating signals. This strategy, based at least in part on an HMT-dependent inhibitory histone code, imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases, including LSD1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression. These events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological constitutive gene induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors.", "target": "False"}

Investigation of the specificity of this process has been complicated by TAP-independent factors that influence the amount of peptide that accumulates in the ER in transport assays. We have developed an overexpression system in which binding of peptides to the TAP substrate-binding site and peptide transport by TAP can be quantified separately. Efficiency of peptide accumulation in the ER parallels affinity for the TAP substrate-binding site, but can be modified by interaction with the glycosylation system within the ER and, probably, peptide efflux. Random peptide mixtures of 9-16 aa display significantly higher affinity for the binding site than mixtures of shorter or longer peptides. Peptide binds to TAP heteromers in the absence of ATP and is released by the binding of ATP, suggesting a model for TAP function.", "target": "False"}

Gilboa and Matsui ( Econometrica 59 (1991), 859\u2013867) proposed a stability concept directly derived from this dynamic process.

Still, however, little is known about the components mediating ERAD of membrane proteins. Here we show that the evolutionary conserved rhomboid family protein RHBDL4 is a ubiquitin-dependent ER-resident intramembrane protease that is upregulated upon ER stress. RHBDL4 cleaves single-spanning and polytopic membrane proteins with unstable transmembrane helices, leading to their degradation by the canonical ERAD machinery. RHBDL4 specifically binds the AAA+-ATPase p97, suggesting that proteolytic processing and dislocation into the cytosol are functionally linked. The phylogenetic relationship between rhomboids and the ERAD factor derlin suggests that substrates for intramembrane proteolysis and protein dislocation are recruited by a shared mechanism.", "target": "False"}

We obtained binding specificities for 112 DNA-binding proteins representing 19 distinct structural classes. One-third of the binding specificities have not been previously reported. Several binding sequences have striking genomic distributions relative to transcription start sites, supporting their biological relevance and suggesting a role in promoter architecture. Among these are Rsc3 binding sequences, containing the core CGCG, which are found preferentially approximately 100 bp upstream of transcription start sites.

Unlike conventional trafficking signals, which are typically comprised of short linear peptide sequences, Golgi exit of Kir2.1 is dictated by residues that are embedded within the confluence of two separate domains. This signal patch forms a recognition site for interaction with the AP1 adaptor complex, thereby marking Kir2.1 for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi.
