They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals\u2019 fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. \nStory: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. \nQuestion: Which species would have lower chance of passing their genes on to the next genertion, rhino or impala?", "target": "rhino."}

This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this \u201canimal labor,\u201d plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. \nStory: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen. \nQuestion: Which friend didn't have a field with nectar producing flowers?", "target": "Jill."}

The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid\u2019s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. \nStory: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. \nQuestion: Liquid from which container will boil sooner?", "target": "container A."}
