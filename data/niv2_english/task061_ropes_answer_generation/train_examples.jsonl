These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. \nStory: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. \nQuestion: Would time B see less or more trapped terrestrial radiation than time A?", "target": "more."}

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. \nStory: Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space. Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \"hydraulic safety margin\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. \nStory: Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. \nQuestion: Which region had fewer plants with an ability to change the way the regulated their stomates?", "target": "eastern."}

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). \nStory: Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. \nQuestion: Which team's racers had their muscles prepared for an activity?", "target": "White."}

Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. \nStory: Megan, a sophomore in college, is visiting her grandparents who live out of town. There is a party going on at her grandparents' house because her grandma, Emily, has just retired. There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work. \nQuestion: Is Emily's risk of cancer higher or lower than Megan's?", "target": "higher."}
{"id": "task061-0f2bc3a5212f4d2a9cdf3c9ef3d68c9b", "input": "Background Paragraph: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. \nStory: John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. \nQuestion: Would patient B see nearby objects clearer or blurrier than patient A?", "target": "clearer."}
{"id": "task061-78faf96945eb4c20a73b414b9e31d384", "input": "Background Paragraph: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue.\n\nSmall amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue. \nStory: Grace has been hearing stories about some fantastic sites in the Arctic. She heard about a phenomenon called blue ice and has been wanting to see it. She has some options to go on her vacation, and has been researching them. Her two options she has narrowed down is a small lake called Tiller Lake, and a glacier called Munson Glacier. \nQuestion: Will Munson Glacier have more or less chance of having blue ice than Tiller Lake?", "target": "more."}

Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can\u2019t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before. \nStory: The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food. \nQuestion: Which family had more members that were overweight?", "target": "Bell."}

It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. \nStory: David was studying human history. He selected two specific eras of human history, era A and era B. Era A was before humans had invented agriculture. And, era B was after the invention of agriculture. He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture. \nQuestion: Did era B have higher or lower brith rate than era A?", "target": "higher."}

For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. \nStory: There are two species of animals, the Lips and the Bops, living in the Scallop forest in Montana. These two species have both been living inside the Scallop forest for the entirety of their existence. The Bops have always managed to easily fend off attackers, but the Lips are easily preyed upon and struggle to defend their own from predators. \nQuestion: Which species most likely has a better method of communication?", "target": "Bops."}
