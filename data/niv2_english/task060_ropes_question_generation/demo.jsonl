Governments around the world should seriously consider these issues. Developing nations will also increase demands on natural resources as they build more factories ( Figure below ). Improvements in technology, conservation of resources, and controls in population growth could all help to decrease the demand on natural resources. \nStory: A new country called Zandonia has recently found itself in a crisis. They are consuming far to many natural resources. A recent study concluded that the amount of resources being consumed greatly increased over the past 3 years. This find coincides with a population boom in the region. Before the population boom the demand for natural recources was relatively stable.", "target": "Given a large number of people leave Zandonia, will the demand for natural resources increase or decrease?"}

That\u2019s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight in food every day. You probably couldn't. You would most likely get very sick even if you tried. \nStory: Billy has decided to start collecting insects. He wants to build a vibrant collection, has a bunch of different bug boxes to store them in. So far he has captured some mayflies, and some locusts. He is trying to decide how to take care of them.", "target": "Which of the two insects will Billy have to worry about feeding?"}

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth\u2019s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465\u00b0C (860\u00b0F). That\u2019s hot enough to melt lead!. \nStory: Two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere in class. They also started studying Venus' atmosphere. They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus.", "target": "Which team didn't learn about carbon dioxide clouds?"}
