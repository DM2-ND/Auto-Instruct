However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. \nStory: Two siblings were going to school.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. \nStory: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. \nStory: Greg is an electrical engineer.

Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur.

It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. \nStory: Italy had two distinct regions.

The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. \nStory: Ted had two farmlands.

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. \nStory: Marcy is in her kitchen and fills one blue cup with water and then sticks that cup in the freezer. She then takes a green cup and fills that one with water but sets that one out on the kitchen counter.

Essentially, human population growth can effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution. More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and development. Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move somewhere else. \nStory: There are two identical neighboring planets, Krypton and Gotham, inhabited by the same species of creature.

Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. \nStory: Scientists are finding more and more evidences of water in the outer space.

Also, in most types of matter, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the matter is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. \nStory: Andy has a refrigerator in his house with lots of magnets on it as decorations.

Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland. \nStory: Hank and Dean studied plate tectonics in college.

Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. \nStory: David is an environmental scientist.

Moving these two objects closer to each other requires working against the repulsive force, which increases the potential energy of the system. Conversely, moving two like charges apart will decrease the potential energy. If the objects attract each other, the opposite situtations occur if you pull them apart, you do work against the force, which increases the potential energy of the system, but bringing attractive charges closer together decreases the potential energy. \nStory: A small boy is playing with some magnets.

In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. \nStory: Two friends found out more about cancer. Bill got scared and started making healthy lifestyle choices, while Dan carried on with his life as if nothing happened.", "target": "Which friend didn't start avoiding carcinogens?"}

Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \"highly infectious\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]. \nStory: Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.", "target": "Which town is experiencing fewer mosquitoes?"}

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. \nStory: Two pharma students read about antiviral and antibacterial drugs. Manny read about antiviral drugs, while George read about bacteria and antibacterial drugs.", "target": "Which student didn't read about a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected?"}

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]\n\nAt high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]. \nStory: There was a competition for who can get their 30 lb drone the highest into the air. Team 70 got it 3,348 ft. Team 71 got it 4,459 ft. Team 72 go it 5,560 ft. Team 73 got it 6,671 ft. Team 74 got it 11,126 ft. Team 75 got it 12,237 ft.
