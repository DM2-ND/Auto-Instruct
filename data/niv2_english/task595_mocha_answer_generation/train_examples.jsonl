Sometimes I eat a tomato when mother isn't looking. Next we get out the cheese and grate little pieces off of the big block with a metal thing. When the meat is all done we put it into a bowl. Then we get out the taco shells and put them on the table. Once everything is all chopped up, we take it to the table and call my Dad and sister to eat. \"It smells great!\" my dad says.
