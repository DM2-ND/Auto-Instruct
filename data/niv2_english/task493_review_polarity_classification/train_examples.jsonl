These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g \"Painted from Memory\", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with.
