He wasn\u2019t planning to marry me so I broke up with him, after a week he begged me to marry him but after he rejected my request I started to realize that marrying him was not the right decision - I still love him but we will face many difficulties-. He cried a lot - he never cried before -. He said that he was going to die frim pain. He asked me to say the truth if I want to marry him or not. And I said I want be we must consider the difficulties. Actually I\u2019m not really sure. I do love him but I\u2019ll lose some many people including my parents. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth or not. Please let me know about what should I do? - I never loved anyone else but him, but I\u2019m not sure if I love him enough to lose my family and hurt my mother\u2019s feelings? Am I a horrible person who changed my mind ? ", "target": "not answerable"}

I was never diagnosed for mononucleosis, so I am not even sure if I've ever had it and I wasn't sick at all in the last few months. She is convinced that I am responsible for it, even though kissing is not the only way to pass the virus. I really do feel sorry for her being sick, wasting time and money for doctors and missing lectures at uni and family events, but I don't think I should apologize for something beyond my control and for something I may not be responsible for.

Last time i did I got \u00a320 for like 4 hours work which is fine. Ive been babysitting tonight for 10 hours, made dinner and put them to bed, the lot. They are late back by an hour and a half now. minimum wage for my age bracket is \u00a36.15. for 10 hours work id feel like \u00a360 is good, or something around that price, though in the back of my head i feel greedy because they are family. And I would genuinely be a bit annoyed if I got \u00a320 again, its not like they are poor either.", "target": "not answerable"}
