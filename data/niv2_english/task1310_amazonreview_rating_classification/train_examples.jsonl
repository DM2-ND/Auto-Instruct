The second I got them out of the bag they shipped in, I had to exert a decent amount of effort to separate them just by the small contact patched they had in shipping. Make no mistake, the effort is a pro, not a con. Unfortunately it is stronger than the adhesive it comes with and after trying on multiple surfaces, I have determined it is not a sufficient adhesive for the strength of the loops. This is unfortunate because it otherwise is a great product.
