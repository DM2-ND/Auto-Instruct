Some reviews said it was great for fine hair, but unfortunately, it made my very fine hair greasy and weighed it down. I\u2019ve used a very small amount and tried it for a few weeks, but it just isn\u2019t working for me. It would probably be ok for semi-fine hair, but my search for a shine and anti-frizz product that works on truly super fine hair continues!", "target": "3"}
