North Wales Police said the conditions they were living in were \"utterly appalling\". The arrested man is local to the area and will be questioned by detectives. Another man will be \"voluntarily interviewed\" at a later date. Thursday's operation is part of a wider operation which aims to tackle serious and organised crime in north Wales, with a specific focus on human exploitation. Det Ch Insp Neil Harrison said: \"As a result of this morning's operation we have safeguarded, or simply put, freed, at least three people who are now being assessed.\" A firearm, stolen property and a \"significant amount of unaccountable cash\" were also recovered and will form part of the investigation. Ch Supt Sasha Hatchett, who oversaw the operation, said: \"It is sometimes a common misconception that modern slavery is an issue for other parts of the world. \"The reality is that human trafficking exists right here on our doorsteps in communities across north Wales.\"", "target": "Police have arrested a man for human trafficking offences and taken three people to a \"place of safety\" during a joint operation in Flintshire."}

The council said it was introducing the restrictions on the Purple 17 route to prevent delays and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Opponents to the scheme, which the authority predicts will raise \u00a3100,000 in its first year, said it would create more problems than it would solve. Twenty of the 40 consultation responses urged the council to abandon the plan, claiming it would make access to some properties more difficult. They added that a reduction in the number of on-road parking spaces would harm small shops and businesses. Reading Borough Council said it would retain existing parking spaces and delivery bays \"wherever possible\". CCTV cameras will be used to enforce the restriction, although the level of fine has not yet been revealed. The council said the first sections of the red route will be operational before Christmas. The double red lines can currently also be found in London, Lancashire and the West Midlands.", "target": "Plans to introduce a red route for buses in Reading have been approved."}

But police said further tests to identify them and ascertain the cause of death were required. Three flats were destroyed in the blast and a further five may have to be demolished. As a result of the post-mortem, conducted on Sunday, Thames Valley Police are still treating Mr Schuette as a missing person. The 48-year-old's family have been informed. Following the explosion, the cause of which is unknown, 40 firefighters worked to tackle flames and rescue people trapped in adjacent buildings. A2Dominion, which operates the block of flats, said 13 households remain in temporary accommodation.
