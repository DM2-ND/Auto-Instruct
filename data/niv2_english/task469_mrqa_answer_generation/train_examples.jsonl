FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. In FSHD, the combination of inefficient chromatin silencing of the D4Z4 repeat and polymorphisms on the FSHD-permissive alleles that stabilize the DUX4 mRNAs emanating from the repeat result in inappropriate DUX4 protein expression in muscle cells. FSHD is thereby the first example of a human disease caused by the inefficient repression of a retrogene in a macrosatellite repeat array. \n Question: Which disease is associated with the ectopic expression of the protein encoded by the gene DUX4?", "target": "fshd"}

Between three and six B1 subfamilies were found in these species.

This is consistent with an independent evolution of B1 elements in separate rodent lineages. We exclude the possibility of convergent mutations to explain certain diagnostic characters within the modern B1 quasi-dimers and view these elements as mosaic structures assembling preexisting mutations. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element. \n Question: From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from?", "target": "7sl rna"}

The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the Aegean Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army. \n Question: Which happened first, the Armistice of Mudros, or the Greek offensive operations?", "target": "armistice of mudros"}
{"id": "task469-0b3f273bb3c2482fa1eef0fef4d7e1e2", "input": "Context: McLeod syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis are classified with the so-called neuroacanthocytosis group of syndromes. Both lead to progressive basal ganglia degeneration and were not easily distinguished in the past. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. The present review compares the two conditions and proposes a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Better-defined disease concepts should eventually replace the umbrella term of \"neuroacanthocytosis.\" Animal models are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. A final common pathway is likely for the pathogenesis of these conditions and is most probably shared with Huntington's disease. \n Question: Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?", "target": "xk"}

They meet up by fate at the Colombo airport and form a volunteer team. They rent a van, fill it with supplies and start driving down the coast to see where they can help. They stumble into a tribal village called Peraliya, which has been destroyed by a forty foot wave. During the time the wave hit Peraliya, a train called \"The Queen of the Sea\" was passing by and was washed away killing over 2500 passengers and villagers. The Four volunteers set up a first aid station and found themselves in charge of running a refugee camp with over 3000 people. Their initial two week journey turns into a year long odyssey of heartbreak and hope as the villagers turn against them when donated tsunami relief money does not materialize. The volunteers concentrate on the bigger picture and break every rule in the 'Disaster Aid Books'. \n Question: How many people are in the refugee camp?", "target": "over 3000 people."}

Here, we report on a 14-month-old boy with a reverse phenotype of Sotos syndrome due to the reciprocal duplication of the 5q35.3 region, including the NSD1 gene, detected by array CGH. The phenotype includes delayed bone age, microcephaly, seizures, and failure to thrive. Our case suggests that the gene dosage effect of the NSD1 gene is the likely cause for the reversed phenotype of Sotos syndrome in this patient. \n Question: Which gene is responsible for the development of Sotos syndrome?", "target": "nsd1 gene"}
