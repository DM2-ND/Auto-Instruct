Historically, the state was a \"non-belligerent\" in the Second World War (see Irish neutrality during World War II) and has never joined NATO, although during the Cold War it was anti-communist and aloof from the Non-Aligned Movement. The compatibility of neutrality with Ireland's membership of the European Union has been a point of debate in EU treaty referendum campaigns since the 1990s. The Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice acknowledge Ireland's \"traditional policy of military neutrality\", reflecting the narrow formulation of successive Irish governments.

Passage:Heavy-water reactors may pose a greater risk of nuclear proliferation versus comparable light-water reactors due to the low neutron absorption properties of heavy water, discovered in 1937 by Hans von Halban and Otto Frisch. Occasionally, when an atom of U is exposed to neutron radiation, its nucleus will capture a neutron, changing it to U. The U then rapidly undergoes two \u03b2 decays \u2014 both emitting an electron and an antineutrino, the first one transmuting the U into Np, and the second one transmuting the Np into Pu. Although this process takes place with other moderators such as ultra-pure graphite or beryllium, heavy water is by far the best. \n Links: a. Nuclear proliferation b. Neutron c. Uranium-238 d.

In 1973, Esaki received the Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Brian Josephson, for discovering the electron tunneling effect used in these diodes. Robert Noyce independently devised the idea of a tunnel diode while working for William Shockley, but was discouraged from pursuing it.
