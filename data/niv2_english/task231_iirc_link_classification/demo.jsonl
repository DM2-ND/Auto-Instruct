Passage:Steedman began his career in politics in 1847, twice winning election to the Ohio General Assembly. Afterwards he worked as a railroad conductor and then went to make his fortune in the California Gold Rush in 1849. However, prospecting for gold proved difficult so in 1850, Steedman returned to Ohio. He was appointed to the state's board for public works, served from 1852 to 1857 (as the president three out of those four years). Also during that time, he was admitted to the state's bar association and then established a law practice in Toledo. Steedman became an editor of the North-Western Democrat and Toledo Times newspaper and a major general of the 5th Division in the Ohio State Militia in 1857, holding both positions until the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861. From 1856 to 1860, he also worked as a printer for the United States Congress.\n Links: a. California Gold Rush b. Toledo, Ohio c. Militia d. American Civil War", "target": "a"}

Council and one of a small number of openly gay Republican office-holders. This led to a conflict within his party when President George W. Bush spoke in favor of an amendment to the United States Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Catania opposed the amendment and became a vocal opponent of Bush's 2004 re-election. In response, the District of Columbia Republican Committee decertified him as a delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention. Catania announced his endorsement of the Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, one week prior to the convention. In September 2004, Catania left the party and became an independent, citing his displeasure with its direction on urban and social issues. He was re-elected in 2006 and 2010 as an independent.\n Links: a. Democratic Party (United States) b. Federal Marriage Amendment c. Same-sex marriage in the United States d.
