His early research focused on ion channels that mediate transmission at electrical and glutamatergic synapses and the modulatory effects of dopamine and nitric oxide on retinal synapse networks. Through studies with zebrafish he discovered that the neurotransmitter dopamine decreases the electrical coupling within horizontal cells. Further research showed that it was the increase of cAMP within the cell resulting from dopamine binding to AMPA receptor that led to this decrease in coupling.

By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War II.\n Links: a. World War II b. Bering Sea Arbitration c. Empire of Japan d. Empire of Japan", "target": "c"}

Passage:The rivalry with Britain also led him to support the American revolutionaries in their War of Independence despite his misgivings about the example it would set for the Spanish Colonies. During the war, Spain recovered Menorca and British West Florida in military campaigns, but failed to regain Gibraltar. Spanish military operations in West Florida and on the Mississippi River helped the Thirteen Colonies secure their southern and western frontiers from British attack. The capture of Nassau in the Bahamas enabled Spain to also recover East Florida during peace negotiations.

One year later the Democratic Party of Albania won the new elections. After 1990, Albania has been seeking a closer relationship with the West. What followed were deliberate programs of economic and democratic reform, but Albanian inexperience with capitalism led to the proliferation of pyramid schemes \u2013 which were not banned due to the corruption of the government. Chaos in late 1996 to early 1997, as a result of the collapse of these pyramid schemes, alarmed the world and prompted the influx of international peacekeeping forces.

Billinton died in 1904, before examples could be acquired, but in 1905 his successor Douglas Earle Marsh acquired two steam and two petrol railcars, for comparative purposes with small steam locomotives of the Stroudley A1 and D1 classes fitted for \"motor train\" or \"push-pull\" working. The steam railcars were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company and were of a similar design to those supplied by this company to the North Staffordshire Railway. They were stationed at Eastbourne and St Leonards and ran services on the East and West Sussex coast lines.

By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands.

Passage:Since its debut in 1969, Sesame Street had given Jim Henson's Muppet characters exposure; however, Henson began to perceive that he was becoming typecast as a children's entertainer. Subsequently, he began conceiving a programme for a more adult demographic. Two television specials, The Muppets Valentine Show (1974) and  (1975), were produced for ABC and are considered pilots for The Muppet Show. Neither of the two specials was ordered to series. However, the prime-time access rule was recently enacted, shifting the 7:30 to 8\u00a0pm ET slot from the networks to their affiliates. CBS became interested in Henson's series proposals and expressed intent to broadcast it weekly on its owned and operated stations.

As Atlantic Records only had rights to four Sheridan/Beatle recordings recorded by Polydor Records, they filled the rest of the album with Beatle and British Invasion cover songs. When this material was released by Atco Records, there were mono (catalogue number 33-169) and stereo (SD 33-169) editions. Atco also added additional drum overdubs to the four Sheridan cuts on top of the original drum tracks.

Since a decrease in energy corresponds to an increase in light's wavelength, this effect would produce a redshift in spectral lines that increase proportionally with the distance of the source. The term \"tired light\" was coined by Richard Tolman in the early 1930s as a way to refer to this idea.\n Links: a. Fritz Zwicky b. Redshift c. Edward Arthur Milne d. Redshift", "target": "a"}

Passage:The military history of the Aleutian Islands began almost immediately following the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire by the United States in 1867. Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the United States Armed Forces, although the islands played a small role in the Bering Sea Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War II.\n Links: a. 20th century b. Bering Sea Arbitration c. Alaska Purchase d. United States", "target": "c"}

Passage:The children of Joseph Smith Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and his wife Emma Smith, are historically significant because of their roles in establishing and leading the Latter Day Saint Movement, which includes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now called Community of Christ), The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) and several other sects.

In 1860, Joseph Smith III became its prophet and president of the RLDS Church, although they no longer adhere to this practice. The larger LDS Church did not follow that practice, and it was led after Joseph Smith's death by Brigham Young.\n Links: a. Community of Christ b. Joseph Smith c. Church of Christ (Temple Lot) d.

Passage:It would seem that Gill's interests lay elsewhere since after a few years he sold the business, and then spent time equipping Lord Lindsay's private observatory at Dun Echt, Aberdeenshire. In 1874, Gill joined the expedition to Mauritius to observe the transit of Venus. Three years later he went to Ascension Island to observe a near approach of Mars and to calculate its distance. While carrying out these laborious calculations, he was notified of his appointment to the Cape Observatory, which, over the following 27 years he was to refurbish completely, turning it into a first-rate institution. Gill was a meticulous observer and had a flair for getting the best out of his instruments. His solar parallax observations with a heliometer and his calculations of distances to the nearer stars, are testimony to his outstanding work.
