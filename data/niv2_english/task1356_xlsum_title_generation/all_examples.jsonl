The bank is thought to be negotiating a settlement with regulators over its handling of a $6.2bn (\u00a33.9bn) trading loss that emerged last year. Two of its traders have been charged with fraud in relation to that loss. Prosecutors say they hid losses which resulted in the company misreporting its results last year. The two men deny the charges. In the memo, obtained by Reuters news agency, Mr Dimon stressed the company's efforts to improve its internal controls. He says the bank has hired 4,000 staff and spent $1bn to beef up its control group, which has a range of oversight duties including monitoring trading risks, legal compliance and internal auditing. The memo also said that JP Morgan was disposing of businesses that were no longer considered central.

Aviva's research covers debt, excluding mortgages, during the latter months of 2015. It follows figures from the Bank of England which showed consumer borrowing leapt ahead of Christmas. Charities say that, for some individuals, a reliance on credit could become more problematic were interest rates to rise. Increased borrowing can, however, be a sign of confidence in an improving economy. The Aviva report suggested that families were saving \u00a3105 a month on average, with the typical family savings pot totalling \u00a33,150. \"The alarming levels of rising household debt, along with a recent reduction in income and savings levels, paints an uncertain picture for the family purse in 2016,\" said Louise Colley, managing director of protection at Aviva. \"With the possibility that the Bank of England could raise interest rates this year, families who have grown accustomed to cheaper credit - particularly those who have spent heavily over the Christmas period - need to ensure they are still fully prepared to manage debt repayments, as well as other monthly outgoings, should rates go up,\" she said.", "target": "Family debt continues to rise - report"}

The species carries crayfish plague, a \"devastating\" fungal disease that has \"significantly threatened\" the native population in the south, the EA said. Judith Bennett, from the agency, said it can \"wipe out a native population\" which has no natural resistance. The crayfish were found in a river in the Lune Valley. \"Fortunately, in this instance, it appears that the signal crayfish were already dead when they were dumped in to the river,\" Ms Bennett said. \"We remain concerned that someone may have tried to release live signals into the water, which could be potentially devastating.\" Two recent outbreaks of crayfish plague have been identified in Yorkshire and Devon. It is an offence to release American signal crayfish into the wild or to trap or kill native crayfish.", "target": "American signal crayfish 'dumped' in Cumbrian river"}

Some key indicators show that in China overall satisfaction with jobs, social security, and leisure provisions has reached the lowest point since 2006. People are worried about inflation and their personal future, researchers say. In their annual Book of China's Society, the researchers paint a picture that is a far cry from the harmonious society the country's leadership trumpets. Despite China's phenomenal growth, there has been a drop in people's confidence in the economy and in the government's ability to manage economic, social and international affairs. The researchers put this down to the impact of the international financial crisis, rather than any widespread abuse of power or increasing restriction on moving up the social ladder. They say that China is fast moving from an agricultural society to an industrial one, with more farmers leaving the land for the cities. On the sensitive issue of income distribution, the researchers say the rate of wealth growth for the rural population will outstrip that of the cities this year, but the gap between rich and poor is still widening.", "target": "Social discontent rising in China, says report"}
