We can expect that he'll cut and paste his mud slinging and name calling.  Why hell, he's even brought on his campaign board the guy who created the Willie Horton campaign ad that was used against Dukakis.  Yep, that's where the un-presidential campaign is headed.  Voters will buy tRump in his own sewer.  I can't wait to see Hillary unleash Bill.  American voters hated the Republicans hypocrisy when they tried to impeach Clinton and it didn't work.  I wonder if the Larry Flint- style  machine will come out of the woodwork.  LOL", "target": "No"}
