Stimulation of cell surface receptors with growth factors and chemoattractants generates ROS, which relay signals from the cell surface to key signaling proteins inside the cell. ROS act within cells to promote migration and also in nonmigrating cells to influence the behavior of migrating cells. Hydrogen peroxide has also been suggested to act as a chemoattractant in its own right, drawing immune cells to wounds. We discuss recent progress made towards understanding how organisms use ROS, and to what degree they depend on them, during the related processes of cell migration and adhesion.", "target": "Redox regulation of cell migration and adhesion."}

But it may not be that simple.   The idea that reducing antibiotic use would redress the problem formed part of a positive response on the part of the United Kingdom government to the House of Lords report,1 including a public information campaign, surveillance of resistance along the food chain, targets with respect to hospital acquired infections, and setting up of an overarching advisory body on all aspects of antibiotic use. However, the concept of overuse has proved too simplistic, for, although the evidence of overprescribing as the \u2026", "target": "Resistance to antimicrobials in humans and animals."}

In this study, we investigate the physical basis of biological patterning of the Drosophila retina in vivo. We demonstrate that E- and N-cadherins mediate apical adhesion between retina epithelial cells. Differential expression of N-cadherin within a sub-group of retinal cells (cone cells) causes them to form an overall shape that minimizes their surface contact with surrounding cells. The cells within this group, in both normal and experimentally manipulated conditions, pack together in the same way as soap bubbles do. The shaping of the cone cell group and packing of its components precisely imitate the physical tendency for surfaces to be minimized. Thus, simple patterned expression of N-cadherin results in a complex spatial pattern of cells owing to cellular surface mechanics.", "target": "Surface mechanics mediate pattern formation in the developing retina"}
