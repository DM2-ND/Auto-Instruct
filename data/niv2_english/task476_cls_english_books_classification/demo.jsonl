This has got to be one of the most touching and powerful books I have ever read in all my 48 yrs as an avid reader.  For anyone who doubts that God takes broken people and makes masterpieces, this is a \"must read\".  To see the Hand of God weave these lives together and make a beautiful tapestry was a joy for me.  I have very few books that made me cry, but this one evoked every extreme emotion from me.  To top all that off, it is a true story.  An absolute pleasure and a cherished experience.", "target": "POS"}

What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, \"Volumes 1-3 (of six).\"  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere", "target": "NEG"}

They're just such an amusing read; I even teach with them.  Don't forget to read \"The Frying Pan of Doom.", "target": "POS"}
