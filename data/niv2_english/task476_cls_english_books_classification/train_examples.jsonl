The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.    This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.

There definitely is a slow unwind at the start for the first hundred and fifity pages or so, but I personally found much of it engaging. Beyond the main love story and Lisey's coping with grief over the loss of her writer husband, much of the book deals with Scott's damaged childhood, and the outlets the creative mind take to cope and fabricate in order to survive, but also in his case, to thrive.  The climax for me was a slight disappointment, however the book overall was a reinvigorated and different world for King", "target": "POS"}

Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path.

De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face.  The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc.  He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them.  My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone.

In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence", "target": "NEG"}

In this particular edition of the Communist Manifesto, the reader is treated to an introduction by Leon Trotsky, one of the central leaders of the Russian Revolution as well as some correspondence from Marx and Engels.  But it is the Manifesto itself which bears repeated readings and discussion.  How could such a short work have been the basis for revolutions around the world?  It is due I think to the fundamental points made: i.e. that workers of the world must unite---as they have more in common with each other than their own national rich and powerful.  In very brief but cogent explanations, Marx and Engels give a concise history of mankind and prove that all history in the \"history of class struggles\".
