As an author, Maeve Binchy makes me want to throw in the towel every time I have the privilege of reading one of her books.  She is the Dickens of our day.  No one can bring characters to life, and use a turn of a phrase like her.  She is so pointed in her depth of understanding humanity, it's incredible.  I am so glad she chooses to share the gift with her readers rather than just run off with the cash she's already made.  : )  This book is one of her best, with the setting of Rossmore being its own true character and all the supporting characters making it a place so real, I want to book a trip now!

This book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers. He teaches you almost everything on the market's technical behavior.     The naive part is that he uses, in my humble opinion, old school indicators - like 50SMA and 200SMA. Also, he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions. Of course, I wish this were true but I think in today's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that.     So what does there need to be? I don't know, but let me tell you one important thing: Just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back, don't let that fool you into thinking that's how the market is _always_ going to behave.

The author has taken great pains to measure and analyze Vermeer's paintings, finding a striking feature that many of them, when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting, imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures.  The author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that Vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings.    This comes off as very plausible, though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor.  It would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings (chairs, musical instruments, etc) and applied to more of the paintings.    I think the only real failing in the argument is that Vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality, and therefore not needed the aid of a camera.  As pointed out in the text, he was not bound to perfect accuracy; there are some deviations", "target": "POS"}

Appleby has a remarkable feel for the politics of the early Republic, and does a brilliant job of recreating for a modern reader exactly what the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans were fighting over.  She makes a strong case that Jefferson stood for democracy, against elitist opponents who sought to exclude common people from voting.    The core of her argument is that Jeffersonian republicanism is at the heart of our modern conception of democracy, and that both contemporary political parties -- the Democratic and the Republican -- draw equally on his legacy.

Yes, it took me nearly three months to read this novel, but not because I'm that slow of a reader. More likely, the story and characters were so interesting that I preferred dragging out each chapter to save myself from moving forward to year 5.

Dick wrote this in collaboration with another sf great, Roger Zelazny, though the end result is not really one of either author's best efforts. In a post-World-War-III wasteland a religion has grown up around the God of Wrath, whose human embodiment is one Carleton Lufteufel, the government official who detonated the doomsday device that contaminated the Earth's atmosphere with radioactivity. Limbless painter Tibor McMaster sets off in his cart on a quest to find Lufteufel to capture the god's true visage in a painting. There's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated Christianity with this life-negating religion (Deus Irae means \"God of wrath\") and a somewhat Zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel's conclusion. The religious preoccupation gives the novel interest as a kind of reflection of Dick's other greater novels of the late 60s and 70s, despite the somewhat casual and fragmented history of its composition", "target": "POS"}

The commentary itself is full of Greek word studies, historical and geographical points, maps, and solid exegesis of every passage in Acts.

The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.     I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:    In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.    Love is worth fighting and dieing for.    Love is stronger than evil.    What does not kill you, makes you stronger.    Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.

The writing was smooth and concise, with excellent flow, and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless.  Wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life, a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood, while also creating a certain honesty that (eventually) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like.  A side-effect of this detached viewpoint, however, is that at first I felt somewhat removed from what was happening.  But I slowly warmed up to the young Wolff, and by the end I came to cheer for him.  I also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up, feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words.  Wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest, tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear.  Overall I would recommend the book highly, and I plan on reading more from this author", "target": "POS"}

A few similarities are apparent. Both are sharp-witted, female New Yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners. Yet, if Parker could be considered a painter of the urban American landscape in the 1920s through 1950s, Lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s. I don't think she has Parker's depth or sense of structure. Her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin. And she often relies way too heavily on puns. Several pieces in this collection fall flat for me. Yet others - such as her advice to heiresses, \"At Home with Pope Ron,\" and \"The Last Laugh\" - were quite clever.
