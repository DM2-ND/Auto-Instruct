The accepted explanation of the results was first proposed by the graduate students Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck, though relativistic correctness would have to wait for Dirac. Classically, the expected result was a broad beam with a central peak, because an atoms magnetic moment may be oriented arbitrarily. Though it has been repeated many times with different beams, the original used a beam of silver atoms that passed between magnetic plates, which resulted in the beam splitting into 2 components.
