Dense galactic clusters perturb the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation through an inverse form of this, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Plank's constant divided by a particle's rest mass times the speed of light gives its namesake wavelength, and the derivative of its cross-section is given by the Klein-Nishina formula. For 10 points, name this effect which describes a decrease in the wavelength of a photon when it collides with an electron, an American physicist's namesake scattering.", "target": "Science"}
