Needless to say I did not yank or pull hard when inserting my Kindle. Why would I? It was new and the last thing I'd want was to damage it. However, there I was with the two bottom retaining straps ripped off the case with no effort at all. Fortunately, Amazon corrected the problem instantly by applying a full refund. I will stick to \\\\\"known\\\\\" brands from now on and add this brand to my list of \\\\\"Brands to Avoid\\\\\".

Then came a barrage of firmware updates and the device is no longer stable. It doesn't maintain an AC link to my WUMC710.  The Cloud Connect reports ridiculous device information.  It will apply one device name to multiple devices and/or with apply multiple devices' mac addresses to one device.  The management of the router becomes frustrating because I have to keep resetting it and reapplying the correct names and icons for each device because you can reserve the IP address to network appliances when the MAC address for a server gets attached to a Printer.  The QOS is not stable.  The internet problems started 2 firmware updates ago with slow speeds, unresponsiveness, and 404 errors, on some wired devices, while simultaneously wireless nodes were reaching the domains with out issues or vice versa.  The fact the device required so many firmware updates and poorly tested ones at that makes this device unreliable.<br /><br />I no longer support Cisco or its products with my Time or Money.
