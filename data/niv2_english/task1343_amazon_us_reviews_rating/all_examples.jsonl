The external drive has its own power supply, so the blue cable is not feeding power to the drive's needs. I tried one large backup using these cables, and the backup was corrupt, unusable. To me, they are a waste of money. I can use them with a thumb drive plugged into the blue cable for small to medium file transfers, but that's not what I bought these for.

The build is good, with a textured green surface and no sharp edges.<br /><br />My build used an Intel i3-540 processor and Asus motherboard and on-board video, I have no complaints - it's rock solid with this power supply. No power cord, but I knew that before purchasing.", "target": "Positive Review"}

Still the burner did an acceptable if not perfect job of writing single and double layer DVDs. But when I went to burn CD-R I got nothing but coasters using 2 different burning programs. I have 2 other burners, and the blank media worked ok, leaving the conclusion the burner was defective. SO ENUF, and it went back to the dealer.

It wasn't until I tried to close it and store it that I realized this wasn't going to work. The case would not shut correctly. I tried several times to get it to lock and secure, but it didn't seem like it was designed correctly to stay shut. I immediately packed it up and sent it back. I guess I'll be trying another product. Another note I would make is that it didn't feel sturdy. Very thin plastic and definitely not $30 worth of quality.", "target": "Negative Review"}

A few months ago the pod went out completely.. now no matter which direction I twist the wheel it only turns the volume up to maximum and sticks there, blasting my eardrums while I fumble to unplug the blaring noise. Its a shame such nice quality speakers are ruined over such a poor accessory.", "target": "Negative Review"}

I will update upon a response.  Update: Amazon processed a return and credit, and I bought the same product from a national vendor via Amazon.

My Husband purchased my Kindle for me for Mothers Day this year and since then I have carried it every where with me.  I consider this gift to be one of my very best gifts from him.  I absolutely love my Kindle. It is true you can read it in the bright sun light. I have read more books since I got my Kindle.  I also purchased the cover with the reading light in it and I have just one small complaint about the light, the light does not hit all the way to the bottom of the page so it is hard to read the last few lines.  Other than that it is great and a good protector for the Kindle. All in All I think this is the greatest invention since sliced bread.  I give the Kindle FIVE STARS.

This is super small but the sound is really clear and quite amazing for such a small speaker.  I have yet to test the battery life but the size is truly amazing for the sound it produces.  Sure the bass isn't there and it's really not to be expected in a speaker this small but the clarity and fullness of the sound even at higher volume levels is quite remarkable.  If you are looking for something that will produce better sound and more volume then the standard iPad or iPhone speaker without spending a ton of money - this is it.  I'm sure the Jambox and larger Logitech speakers sound even better but they are also bigger and more expensive.  For the price and size, I think this one is very hard to beat.

I used NVIDIA before and never experienced such problems.    Most often the screens will stay black even so the computer is still running (for example I can still hear audio book sound being played), but I can't get the screens (which are not in sleep mode) to turn their displays back on.  Sometimes I get the windows blue screen with some text showing that the crash happens in the video driver.  Anyways quite disappointing.

I think this is a horrible practice and now that I have my refund i want to warn others that obviously NOT all of these reviews can be trusted because you are nicely being threatened with your refund.

It was exactly what I was looking for, a protective case that didn't have an annoying flap that gets in the way and irritates my hands when trying to use my Ipad.  Here is the problem.  The cover is made of such soft silicone material that it CONSTANTLY SLIPS OFF.  All I have to do it look at it the wrong way and it falls off.  Another short coming is the center button area.  It slips off there as well because its even thinner for the fingerprint scanner and it comes off if I try to scan my thumb.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Historically, Poetic has made great cases etc.., I even have 2 of their other cases on my kids Kindle HD 7's and they have been great.  Here is my suggestion if anyone at Poetic reads these things.  You need to put some type of rigid material in the seams along the edges or corners to give it some strength so It will not peel off.

I have a 9600 and this 9500 on two identical PCs at home and I do have a small boost in benchmarks on the 9500.  <br />Apart from having a great GPU, the Tachyon 9500 is great for enthusiasts.  It allows hassle-free overclocking and I might say that the TGM software it includes is incredibly easy to use.  I've been able to overclock at a stable 320MHz core / 600 MHz memory speeds without a sweat. <br />Finally, you get all the video options you'd expect from ATI chipsets, such as great DVD playback and such.<br />I highly recommend this video card to anyone looking for a GPU in this price range.

This time I purchased two 3-packs for a couple of offices and ran into problems with the current software (UniFi V3.2.10) and Java after installation.  This is posted as a known issue on the company site for a previous version (v3.2.5) and was supposedly corrected with version 3.2.7.  Unfortunately the solutions they have posted (for v3.2.5) did not work and required contacting Ubiquiti for a solution.  Ubiquiti ONLY offers support via email (no phone support).  When I received the correct solution I asked why it wasn't posted on their support site.  The response I received was that it is on the site and I should read the link the support tech just included in his second response.  The link provided didn't have the same solution they e-mailed me.  I informed the tech of this and his response was &#34;This case is closed&#34;.

My fire fits in it perfectly. The seller contacted me about a problem they had with the shipping of the colored cases and offered a refund or exchange for black if I didnt want to wait. I chose to wait and am glad I did, my order still arrived only a day after the original estimated window. It works nicely in both landscape and portrait view. You can see the difference in the different angles and can also just fold the case back if you arent in need of the angles.

It arrived quickly, and hookup was no problem once I got the appropriate gender changer.  One quirk was that it liked being in one USB port on my computer over another, the first port I plugged into Windows XP said the device would perform better if it were plugged into a high-speed port or some such thing.

They give you a spray bottle (I think about 4-6 oz. of spray)for applying the screen protector. I would highly recommend you apply this in a room that has very little air movement to avoid any dust settling on the screen while you apply it.  Get a 2nd person to help you. Their job is to spray and nothing else. I followed the instructions and did a few extra steps like: 1) Spray your Ipad screen lightly and spray your Zagg screen protector till it is almost dripping. Be very careful you don't let the screen protector flop onto itself.  It is an extreme pain to seperate it from itself. It took me 3 tries of positioning the cover and I had to spray it every time I started over.  After 24-36 hours, my screen dried and I didn't notice any air bubbles left.  Good Luck!

From what I have seen on the internet, I thought that MSI was a good brand that built quality motherboards that were &#34;Military Class.&#34;  How I was wrong.  Installation went nice for a first time PC builder like myself.  However, during the installation of Windows 7, I encountered a problem when the computer had to reboot.  The monitor would enter sleep mode, but the actual computer would stay on.  It would then require a manual shut down and a manual push of the power button.  Since this was prior to any software being installed on the computer, I had reason to  believe that it was the motherboard.  Through further research on the internet, I found out that another person on the internet had the EXACT same problem on the EXACT same motherboard.  This person managed to solve the problem by simply purchasing a different motherboard.  After that I have returned this product.  If anyone with knowledge on this or has experienced a similar problem, I am welcome to comments.", "target": "Negative Review"}

This one however is truly translucent. It also does not add any thickness to the iPad 2. It will protect the iPad from scratches or dents which I was looking for.

It turned out it was necessary to power off and on the Linksys router also.  I immediately noticed the increase in speed which, according to the various online meters, doubled.

They are the type of businesses where I would always like to purchase my stuff.<br />The packing was more than what I expected and even inside the CPU there was some foam in order to protect the memory, motherboard, etc.  I want to thank this company again.  Keep up the good work.", "target": "Positive Review"}

There are MANY MANY existing issues which have not been resolved in firmware upgrades, even Linksys site has the issues listed yet has not put out a new firmware in well over a year. Yet they recently put out a firmware for Britain which fixed the issue with connections being dropped. Even then, this router randomly drops connections after a few hours, VPN through this router is nearly impossibly if you need to use your connection for more than 10 minutes. And what takes the cake is that a simple firmware update bricks the router, amazing.
