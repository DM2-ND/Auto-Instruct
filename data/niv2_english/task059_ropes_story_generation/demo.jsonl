Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.", "target": "Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife.  They would often complain about the weather."}

These areas, called growth plates , allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life. This thickening occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from weight-lifting exercises.", "target": "John was a relatively thin and bone-y child when he was younger. He would often get bruises and was prone to breaking bones. As an adult however he does lots of weight lifting and hasn't broken a bone yet."}

The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant . If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars. Red giants are red because the surface of the star is cooler than white or blue stars, but remain highly visible because of their gigantic size.", "target": "A star names Andromeda has been being observed for years. Over time, it has been seen that the star remains visible but has been turning more and more red."}
