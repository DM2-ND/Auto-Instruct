I try to keep a good relationship with her for our now adult children, but obviously I have some resentment.\n\nOne of my nieces reached out to me and told me that she was giving me a head's up that she would like my ex to come to her wedding. I wrote back and politely told her I'd rather she didn't come. My niece's father (my brother) called me and chewed me out for saying no and told me that I was doing a disservice to my whole extended family for trying to cut out his kid's aunt. I pointed out that she's technically not her aunt anymore and I'm a member of the family and she isn't, especially since she chose to leave, and now my kids will have to spend the wedding between both parents, rather than with me, since it is my side. He told my I could either get over it or not come. AITA?", "target": "WRONG"}
