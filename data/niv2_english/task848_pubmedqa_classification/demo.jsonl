However, the prognostic role of a GRAF transcript has not been studied in patients with AML.', 'In this study, we investigated the expression of the GRAF transcript by real time quantitative PCR in 60 AML patients and 30 healthy age and sex matched controls.', 'GRAF expression was significantly lower in patients with AML when compared to controls (P=0.008). There were no significant differences in clinical features, FAB subtypes and cytogenetic risk subgroups between patients with high and low GRAF expression levels. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high GRAF expression had longer overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that, besides WBC count, GRAF expression was also an independent prognostic factor for AML.", "target": "0"}

The tag-CpG of the MEG8-DMR was investigated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.', 'In all three patients, the identical pattern of DNA-hypermethylation of the MEG8-DMR was observed along with DNA-hypomethylation of the IG-DMR and MEG3-DMR.", "target": "1"}

We hypothesized that specialized ambulatory anesthesia teams produce better patient outcomes such as lower postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) rates, lower postoperative pain scores, and shorter postanesthesia care unit (PACU) lengths of stay (LOS).', 'In this prospective observational study, we collected outcomes data on 1,299 patients including incidence of PONV, PACU LOS, maximum and average pain scores, amount of postoperative opioid use, and rescue antiemetic use.', 'Ambulatory anesthesiologists had statistically shorter phase 2 PACU LOS times (P < .05) and overall recovery times (P < .01). The PONV incidence odds ratio for ambulatory versus nonambulatory anesthesiologists was 1.31 (95% CI 1.01-1.72). We found no significant difference in the amount of postoperative opioid use, maximum postoperative pain scores, or PACU phase 1 LOS time.", "target": "0"}
