I'm good thank-you and you?\nSeller: Vey well. How can i help you?\nBuyer: Do you have the title to the truck? Are there other rips on the seats? When was the last time it had a tune up?\nSeller: Yes i have the title! Not only are there no rips on the seats they are heated as well. The entire interior is beautiful and it was barely driven it only has 68000 miles on it.\nBuyer: Super now is it at all possible to lower the price? It's something I'd like it's just out of my budget.\nSeller: I would be willing to go to 6000 but no lower. Are you willing to accept that?\nBuyer: I was thinking more around 4,000.\nSeller: No for a truck in this condition with this many miles on it it is worth far more than that i will drop to 5800 but no lower.\nBuyer: Wow, you're sure solid. Is there any way you could go 5500? \nSeller: Sure\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n", "target": "car"}

Otherwise, I would have kept it for years, I'm sure.\nBuyer: Congratulations on the BINGO win! As you no longer need it, I feel that $120 is unreasonable. Because, I will also have to get a data plan which will cost more money. I can meet you at a predetermined location set by you. If I like the phone, I will give you $80 cash.\nSeller: I'm sorry I can't go that low. I feel that $120 is a very fair price for a phone in this condition, but I will be willing to part with it for $100 if you can pay cash today.\nBuyer: Do you have a cover for the phone?\nSeller: Yes, I have a like-new otterbox for this phone that I will be happy to throw in at the $100 price.\nBuyer: Come down to $95 and you have yourself a deal. I will stay pay cash of course :)\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n", "target": "phone"}

Can you give me more details?\nSeller: Yes, absolutely! This is a very fine piece. In 2017 one of this biggest problems is that people can't leave voice messages on your land line. This bad boy solves all of that. It not only records the message, it also notes the date and time. It can even be mounted on the wall with velcro or used as a target for your shotgun!\nBuyer: Haha. Would you be willing to take $16 for it?\nSeller: Sorry, but I think the lowest I could go is $15\nBuyer: Okay $15 sounds good to me.\nSeller: Alright, if you're going to pull my leg, I can do $14.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n", "target": "electronics"}
