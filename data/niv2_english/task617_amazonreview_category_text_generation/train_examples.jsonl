Dogs (Yorkshire, Shih-Tzu) will only eat the outer coating and leave the inner portion laying on the floor. The inner appears to be similar to the plain rawhide chews. I your four legged friend doesn't mind those chews then this might be a good purchase for you. As for our dogs we will have to go with something more tasteful.", "target": "pet products"}

I opened the package and they are HUGE. They are extremely LONG, and overly thick, and for a normal-sized eye person like myself, when I applied them they go up AND past my eyebrows. The entire website claims they are natural lashes...yet they can't possibly be. I ordered one set thinking it was a mistake but I have now ordered another set and they are the exact same gigantic size. Don't be fooled by all the positive ratings. They are unwearable.", "target": "beauty"}

I later learned that it\u2019s impossible for such a cord to work due to its structure. A converter like this would require a power source in order to work and it has no input for a power source, and while yes HDMI cords produce electricity, only a little and would fail to make such a cord work. I suggest buying a converter that allows for power input as that is more likely to work and be effective versus this cash grab product. Don\u2019t waste your money", "target": "electronics"}

It's not the shape pictured in the listing, as you can see. Also, there is no dimmer switch, or any switch at all, for that matter. All that came in the box was the lamp, a glass dish to set in the top, a leaky bottle of lavender oil, and a USB converter, so you can either plug it into a USB socket or a two pronged outlet. The wood base is nice, but has an over-sized piece of vinyl glued to it, so it doesn't \"hide\" under the wood. I turned it on for about three hours, and it didn\u2019t get hot enough to make the oil drops I put in the cup disperse. Very disappointed. If you want a salt lamp, try one of the more expensive ones.", "target": "home improvement"}

It ran with the pick up truck battery for a few hours until it beeped and stoped. In the morning I turned on the pick up with no problem, the battery still had enough charge. Although I operated the cooler in low speed without using the small pump, I tested it in high speed and pump and it also worked fine. So far so good. I did not liked that the cables to conect to the battery are short and the loop holes are very tiny, so you have to improvise to conect it to the battery. Also it does not come with the lighter conection. Update. After a few uses it stopped working.", "target": "automotive"}
