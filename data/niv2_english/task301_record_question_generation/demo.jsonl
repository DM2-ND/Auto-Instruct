A team at Arizona State University has proposed building 10 million wind-powered pumps to draw up water and spill it out onto the surface of the ice, where it will freeze faster. Doing so would be complicated and expensive -- it's estimated to cost a cool $500 billion, and right now the proposal is only theoretical. But the need to solve the problem is urgent, said professor of astrophysics Steven Desch. He and a team of scientists published a study about how to refreeze parts of the Arctic in the December 2016 issue of the \"Earth's Future\" journal.Scientists propose building 10 million machines to refreeze part of the Arctic Sea'There will be no summer sea ice by 2030' on the Arctic, says study", "target": "The inspiration came to _ after attending several climate change conferences in 2012."}
