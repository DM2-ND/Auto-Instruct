Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so", "target": "NEG"}

As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who \"ruined\" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.    Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).    Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see", "target": "NEG"}

Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.
