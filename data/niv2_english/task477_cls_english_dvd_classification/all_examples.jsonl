It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama.  Henry Czerny, though, gives  a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part.

But with the exception of 'The Lodger',  Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife'  certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT  when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one  sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus  points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis  introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good)  score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this  DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look  to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock  enthusiast", "target": "NEG"}

There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.  It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.

This film  is too jolly and innocent.

Al Pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way.

Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending.

The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.     My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.     Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into.", "target": "NEG"}

From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with  consentual desire already.

This documentary observes 11 year olds learning body discipline, social etiquette, appropriate attire on their way to achieving a sense of self respect, personal dignity.     Some of the children inhabit neighborhoods where they stumble across drug addicts and dealers each day. The teachers of 3 different schools reveal secret tricks to overcome physical and social awkwardness in children and open them to their potential for becoming accomplished through structure, practice and smiling.    The children openly discuss their fears (my dad cheated on my mom) and hopes (do you like girls?) between classes as they march toward the selection process for the citywide competition (bronze, silver, gold levels) quarter, semi-finals and the glorious finals outdoors in sunlight.    The music is charming nostalgic, the dancing exhilarating; the children's enjoyment of their bodies in motion is contagious.

The love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers.    The biggest selling point of the cast is Ms. Rachel McAdams.  I saw her in WEDDING CRASHERS and I've been anxious to see more of her work.  She is gorgeous AND she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie.  I predict her as one of Hollywood's up & coming stars (at least I hope so!).    For a guy whose father suffers from Alzheimers, this movie really hit home.   An interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young (their courtship) and the period of their Golden Years.    This is a must-see movie, even for people who don't normally care for \"mushy\" movies.  In a single word, this story is unforgettable.", "target": "POS"}

I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't \"get it\" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.     That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally \"get it\", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it", "target": "POS"}

Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman", "target": "NEG"}

He seemed held back, as if he could not fully express his abilities. It appears as though he did not want to \"show up\" the other actors.   As much of a Jet Li fan as I am, I regret to say that this move disapointed me.   BMX and Jet Li did not fit together well. I think that Jet Li's part could almost have been anybody else.   The story also disapointed me. It did not seem right that a cop,(from Tiwan) and a thief got together to save the world. It didn't make sense.", "target": "NEG"}

The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD.
