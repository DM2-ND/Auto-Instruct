There was no association between SIRS and unplanned readmission in the postoperative PCNL patient. Despite discharge during the first postoperative day, patients with SIRS (without fever or struvite stones) had no increased risk for unplanned return. Our findings suggest that the development of SIRS immediately following PCNL does not preclude safe discharge on the first postoperative day.", "target": "no"}
