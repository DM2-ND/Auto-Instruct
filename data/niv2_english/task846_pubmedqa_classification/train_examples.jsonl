For example, diverse metabolic profiles among bacterial symbionts may have been selected by dissimilarities in nutritional requirements of their different nematode hosts. Similarly, factors involved in parasitism (e.g. immune suppression and microbial competition factors), likely differ based on evolution in response to naturally encountered organisms, such as insect hosts, competitors, predators or pathogens.

This leads to circulatory stabilization of septic animals, but not a decrease in the anaerobic share of glycolysis. A positive fluid balance in control animals does not result in alteration of muscular aerobic glycolysis. Decreasing glycerol levels in both groups give evidence that a positive fluid balance does not exert a negative impact on cell metabolism.", "target": "no"}

Substantial insulin resistance is identifiable early in course of illness, perhaps secondary to treatment.", "target": "no"}

With no effect of stimulation on APAs it is unlikely that this would be a mechanism of impaired balance in the patients after the surgery.", "target": "no"}

Hence, the non-canonical \u03c332 targets identified in our previous study are likely to be genuine. We propose that the failure of Waldminghaus and Skarstad to identify many of these \u03c332 targets is due predominantly to the lower data quality in their study. We conclude that surprising ChIP-chip results are not artifacts to be ignored, but rather indications that our understanding of DNA-binding proteins is incomplete.", "target": "no"}

This result suggests that the U deletion activity, which is required for RNA editing, is primarily mediated in vivo by KREX1 which is normally found associated with only one type of editosome.
