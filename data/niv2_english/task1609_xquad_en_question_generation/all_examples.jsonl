This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such 'self-cloaked' viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as 'non-self' structures.", "target": "What is the process by which the adaptive immune system is evaded by the chainging of non-essential epitopes called?"}

Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections.

In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms.
