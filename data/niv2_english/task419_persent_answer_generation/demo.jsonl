Such work is crucial to help displaced Iraqis return to their homes safely.\n Lodhammar  said UNMAS needs another $216 million this year for  its  operations in 32 areas of Iraq  including the northwestern city of Mosul  on top of 116 in commitments and pledges already made.\n He  said UNMAS and other United Nations agencies were hoping for around $45 million to be set aside for safe returns of Iraqis as part of money being pledged at a donor\u2019s conference for Iraq in Kuwait on Wednesday.\n Lodhammar  said  it  would be \u201cof course concerning if we don\u2019t reach the amounts envisaged and hoped for  but I believe that it is an ongoing process. I think more donors will be coming to the table.\u201d", "target": "Pehr Lodhammar"}

He  spotted junk-art potential in the suitcases' every detail: the golden emblems that dance across the chocolate background  the zippers  the handles  the drawstring from the dust bag. So  he  purchased one  took it apart when  he  arrived back home in Fishers and began building Darth Vader helmet sculptures. After  he  posted  his  progress on Instagram  @gabrieljunkart  people began asking to buy them. \"People were like 'Oh my God  these are my two passions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Louis Vuitton and Star Wars '\"  Dishaw  said.  He  had no idea people who were fans of both brands even existed.\nKeep tabs on  Mr. Dishaw 's latest work on  his  Instagram.", "target": "Gabriel Dishaw"}
