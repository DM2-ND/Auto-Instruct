Participant data for three follow-up assessments were analyzed.', \"In CN A\u03b2+, subjects with high SMD did not exhibit significantly greater episodic memory decline than those with low SMD. High SMD was related to greater rates of progression to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (hazard ratio\\xa0=\\xa05.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-20.0, P\\xa0=\\xa0.02) compared with low SMD. High SMD was associated with greater depressive symptomatology and smaller left hippocampal volume.\\Question: Does subjective memory decline predict greater rates of clinical progression in preclinical Alzheimer 's disease?", "target": "High SMD is a harbinger of greater rates of clinical progression in preclinical AD. Although SMD reflects broader diagnostic implications for CN A\u03b2+, more sensitive measures may be required to detect early subtle cognitive change."}
{"id": "task849-6e9045ffa4b744d68dca02d2b572d8ac", "input": "Context: The natural history of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its relationship with disease activity is not well known. In this study, we evaluate a prospective cohort of 44 MS patients who were followed every 3 months for 2 years. Cognitive evaluation was done at baseline and by the end of the study using the Brief Repeatable Battery-Neuropsychology. Clinical evaluation included assessment of new relapses and changes in disability (Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) confirmed at 6 months.', 'We found that verbal memory performance deteriorates after 2 years in patients with MS. These changes were observed in stable and active patients both in terms of relapses and disability progression, even at the beginning of the disease, and in patients with or without cognitive impairment at study entry. Attention and executive functions measured with the symbol digit modality test (SDMT) declined after 2 years in patients with confirmed disability progression. Furthermore, SDMT performance correlated with the EDSS change.\\Question: Does memory decline evolve independently of disease activity in MS?", "target": "Our findings indicate that verbal memory steadily declines in patients with MS from the beginning of the disease and independently of other parameters of disease activity."}

The NFLT was divided into superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants. The mean NFLT of each quadrant was analyzed statistically and compared to the results of visual field tests.', 'In all cases, the NFLT decreased significantly upto 3 months after surgery, but increased gradually upto 12 months. In cases with visual field loss, the thickness of the nerve fiber layer that corresponds to the visual field defect diminished strongly, in contrast with other quadrants. Even in cases without visual field loss, the NFLT decreased significantly a month after surgery, especially in the nasal and inferior quadrants.\\Question: Does [ Thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer decrease after vitreous surgery for idiopathic macular hole ]?", "target": "This study demonstrates that the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer decreases at least one month after surgery, even in cases without visual field defect. This fact may suggest the existence of a subclinical complication of vitreous surgery."}
