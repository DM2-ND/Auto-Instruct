Here the cloning, characterisation and functional analysis of Tetrahymena thermophila's DHFR-TS is presented. A first aspect of the presented work relates to destruction of DHFR-TS enzyme function in an alveolate thereby causing an auxotrophy for thymidine. A second aspect is to knock in an expression cassette encoding for a foreign gene with subsequent expression of the target protein.\\Question: Does the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase of Tetrahymena thermophila provide a tool for molecular and biotechnology applications?", "target": "This system avoids the use of antibiotics or other drugs and therefore is of high interest for biotechnological applications."}
