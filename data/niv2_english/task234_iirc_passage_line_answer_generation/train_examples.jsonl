At this time, southern Greece also came under Roman hegemony; however, some key Greek poleis remained partly autonomous and avoided direct Roman taxation. The Hellenistic Kingdom of Pergamon (282\u2013133 BC) was annexed to that territory in 133 BC, when King Attalus III (r. 138\u2013133 BC) willed the lands to Rome; however, the Romans were slow in securing their claim to those lands, and a pretender to the throne of Pergamon, Eumenes III (Aristonicus) led a revolt with the help of the philosopher Blossius, which the Roman army suppressed in 129 BC, when the lands of Pergamon were divided among Rome, the Kingdom of Pontus, and Cappadocia.\n", "target": "The Greek peninsula fell under Roman rule in 146 BC, after the Battle of Corinth, when Macedonia became a Roman province"}

It is typically available in an aerosol spray can, and may sometimes be used for starting direct injected diesel engines or lean burn spark engines running on alcohol fuel.

Passage:Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused when a mutation in the dystrophin gene changes the RNA so that it no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein. This usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the RNA downstream of the mutation, so-called frameshift mutation. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, removing that exon can correct the downstream reading frame, restoring the production of partially functional dystrophin. This is the general strategy used in the design of exon-skipping oligonucleotides for DMD. As there are 79 exons in the longest splice form of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligonucleotides are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with DMD.\n", "target": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused when a mutation in the dystrophin gene changes the RNA so that it no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein"}

Passage:In a publication of 1941, Norman Tindale, together with the American anthropologist Joseph Birdsell, published a paper suggesting that there were 12 Negrito tribes living on the coastal and rainforest areas around Cairns. The idea had been developed by Birdsell during field work in 1937-8. They were characterized by very short stature, curly hair, and yellowy-brown skin. Six of them were Dyirbal speakers, such as the Jirrbal, Girramay, Gulngai and Djiru within the Murray Upper/Tully Area. Of the others, located further north beyond Cairns, two spoke varieties of Djabugay, and three spoke dialects of Yidin. The remaining tribe were the Mbabaram, whom Tindale took to be strong evidence for his hypothesis because their language, in so far as it had been reported, diverged substantially from the surrounding tongues, and appeared to be wholly atypical, compared to the standard Australian aboriginal languages.\n", "target": "In a publication of 1941, Norman Tindale, together with the American anthropologist Joseph Birdsell, published a paper suggesting that there were 12 Negrito tribes living on the coastal and rainforest areas around Cairns"}
