UAA Regents cannot limit our rights, they take state money, which means that if the Legislature passes and the governor signs, then carry on campus is the law.\nAs to the rest of your snide, condescending commentary, it is what it is, a liberal trying to impose his imagined superiority upon the peon.\nNo skin off of my nose.\nI just consider the source.\nYour comment about hiding behind the use of 'liberal' as some sort of shield?  I don't think that was the intent.    Shield?  No.\nI dislike liberal ideology--socialism.\nLenin had a phrase for those who blindly followed the leader:  Useful idiots . . . think about it.", "target": "Yes"}
