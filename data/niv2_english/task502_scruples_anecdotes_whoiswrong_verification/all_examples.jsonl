The next 2 weeks also happens to be spring break where my girlfriend and I go to school. I recently was texting a friend from home and he told me how excited he was to be going on a trip to a legal state with my girlfriend and how much they are gonna smoke and bring back home. This obviously caught be my surprise because my girlfriend had made no mention of booking a flight or even spending time away from home for break. We\u2019ve been together for several years and I trust her but I still think that if the tables were turned I would at least run the idea by her before I decided to make such a major decision, especially if it were with another girl other than my GF. My girlfriend said she was sorry and that it \u201chappened so quickly she didn\u2019t think to tell me\u201d. I really don\u2019t know what to do or how to react here so any help would be appreciated.", "target": "yes"}

So I dated this girl for 7 months and it was an honest and trustworthy relationship, we had a bit of a conflict one night and we decided we should take maybe a month to think things through and figure everything out between each other. So we split up and stayed friends that month but gave each other enough space. A month later we got back together and most things were fixed between us. She then tells me a day or two later after we get back together that at some party she was all over another guy and didn\u2019t even remember because she was drunk and tired and hurt over us splitting up. The next day I asked if she regretted it and if she was even sorry about it , she said \u201cI have no reason to regret it and why would i be sorry?\u201d She kept getting agitated because i needed to be reassured of how she felt about me if i wanted to continue this relationship. I thought i deserved an apology.", "target": "yes"}

POST : I just got off this Spirit Airlines flight and I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty right now.\n\nSo we boarded and I got the middle seat assigned to me by the airline. This middle aged couple boards and asked me to switch seats so they can sit together (they had my two surrounding seats). I happily obliged because of course they can sit together and also I do like the window seat.\n\nTowards the end of the flight however, it\u2019s announced that they\u2019re giving away 5,000 miles to the lucky flyer seated in... you guessed it... my original seat.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna list the reasons here why I could really use those miles, but I spoke up and asked. The couple didn\u2019t fight it and said \u201cyea its your seat\u201d but obviously disappointed.\n\nThey seemed like a really nice couple and I feel so guilty... am I a total ass here?", "target": "no"}

I find out from a good friend of hers that she went on a date with someone that I knew. Later that day I tried to call her within the week as well so I wasn't forgetting about her and such and I find out that she cheated (it was more than a date.)  so I try and push it back like nothing happened because I didn't want to instantly get into  a argument, little after that day I confront her and she was trying to act innocent and after that we got into a huge argument about me not talking to her for around a week after I told her that I wouldn't have any time to talk but I tried to call a bit but couldn't since she was sleeping. Little after that argument we broke up and continued our lives.", "target": "no"}

We have an apartment together, two dogs and shared bills. She suffers from mental health, specifically severe anxiety and depression, and finds doing everyday tasks difficult. Me, also having severe depression and anxiety, can understand her struggles. \nFor quite some time now, she has been calling out of work 1-3 times a week because she wakes up to anxious to go. This has been going on since September. \nShe recently told me today that she has to go into a meeting with her manager and the director of HR tomorrow to discuss calling out so much. She called out today.\nMore than likely, she is going to be fired from this job. Now even though I still have feelings for her, I more have been feeling like it\u2019s not there anymore, and I\u2019ve considered breaking up multiple times.
