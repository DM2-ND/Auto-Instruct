Now his job allows 2.5 weeks of vacation time a year, and I\u2019m fortunate to have more time off than him. Over the past year, we discussed taking a long trip to Southeast Asia or India together, and he\u2019s been saving his days off for that. This week he just told me that his mom is offering to take him and his siblings on a trip to Europe. My immediate response was annoyance and disappointment because obviously our vacation plans won\u2019t happen if he use his days off for a family vacation. When I expressed my feelings, his reaction was that\u2019s too bad because he won\u2019t turn down a free vacation. So AITA for expecting him to save his days off for our trip and not use it on a family vacation?", "target": "no"}
