POST : Few days ago me and some other friends came up with the idea of buying a VPS to play minecraft in our own server. \nWe bought a very cheap one (imagine it costs us only 3 euros per 3 months each). So one other friend wanted to join us too, but when i told him about that very small payment he got angry and he left. AITA for asking him to pay too just like everyone else?", "target": "yes"}

Whenever we have an argument, my Dad always takes their side. This I never realised more up until yesterday. One of my brothers recorded a video of me doing something which I told him I didn\u2019t want anyone seeing. A few hours later, he tells me he put it up on Instagram for everyone to see. I get angry/upset and tell him to delete it. My Dad starts telling me to calm down and regardless I\u2019m overreacting but I told my brother I didn\u2019t want anyone seeing. Eventually, he does delete the video but looking back on the situation now I\u2019m a bit upset that my Dad didn\u2019t see where I was coming from and is more on brothers side even though he showed a video of me for everyone to see without my permission. I realise he always does this.\n\nAITA?", "target": "yes"}
