The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.

Elfman's matched his own style, Zimmer's matched his, but Giacchino's matched Mission:Impossibles", "target": "POS"}

Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.    Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity.

I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them.  Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD", "target": "NEG"}

Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.      So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.

This album is practically a single for \"I'm Free\", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about \"I'm Free\"? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.    One star out of five", "target": "NEG"}

Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.

An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first", "target": "POS"}

Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out", "target": "NEG"}

Chamber Music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the Mendelssohn Piano Trios.    Here Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern perform Piano Trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works.  Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important.  But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.    The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05", "target": "POS"}

Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, \"Girl In The Red Dress\" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, \"First Flight Home\" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, \"Corner Club\" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, \"Isabella\".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks \"what exactly is smoothjazz?\"  Play \"Isabella\" for them.  They'll understand.

While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.

I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his \"Hallelujah\" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on \"Grace\" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.

There are often times where we see artists sampling great songs from others, and that has been considered a good or a bad move. Recently, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sampled Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Mary Jane's Last Dance for their funky track, Dani California. Nevertheless, to spin a song of your own, and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic. That is the case for Prince, and his latest single, Fury, the third single from his album 3121. The song samples the opening hook from his 80's track 1999, and takes it into something else. The song actually is good, and delivers a unique feeling of funk, soul & pop. It is a really good track, that still shows that Prince hasn't lost his edge.

First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.

The next day I went and bought this CD and I could not be  happier. The blend of funky blues-like singing, jazzy horn play, and the  rock guitar riffs is awesome. This band reminds me very much of a jazz trio  called Medeski, Martin, and Wood. However, Galactic offers great singing  and horns giving them a much more diverse sound. For me, this is one of  those CD's that I don't know any of the song titles because whenever I  listen to it, I listen to the whole thing straight. If you like jazz and  you like jam bands, get this album", "target": "POS"}

The remixes fare no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious, the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus.

Decca has put together a wide range of early Jazz from a bunch of different artists; some with tracks you would not expect, which I suspect may have been intentional, the dates vary from 1929-1959, but the latter date is a bit misleading (see track list). There is no &quot;modern&quot; jazz here. It is also a self-admitted limited survey, due to the label. Men like Ben Webster and Johnny Hodges are not represented due to the fact that no solos from any Decca, or Decca owned subsidiary, were deemed proper examples of either. But what is included is always classic, even if not the most obvious candidate for the artist. Making up for any shortcomings in that regard is the 79 page booklet included, which is really half the presentation. Well done, informative, and richly packaged, it is a great companion to the disc, and a great gift idea for a jazz aficianado", "target": "POS"}

What a great solo effort and Schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing.  Incredible material, song writing, production and performance by all band members.  Simon Phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks.    Highlight of this CD is the solo at the end of \"Lost Horizons\", that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication.    This is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played.    Awesome!", "target": "POS"}

It was really great to listen to this because I have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago. I think Florence Henderson is a natural for Nellie Forbush, I think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.So many people tend to just think of Ms.Henderson as that famous Mrs.Brady role. One shall be quite surprised. Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets.
