Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.    My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth", "target": "NEG"}

This was made for CD, 15 years to  early.  Okay I like JJ,but this to me is the peak.  And Eric Clapton hasn't  covered a single track of this", "target": "POS"}

A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the \"new\" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love", "target": "NEG"}
