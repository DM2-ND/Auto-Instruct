After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a \"relaxed\" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, \"Heart of Mine\" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site.", "target": "NEG"}

To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song", "target": "NEG"}

It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie \"Nursery Days\" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives.", "target": "NEG"}

Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and \"deep\", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it.
