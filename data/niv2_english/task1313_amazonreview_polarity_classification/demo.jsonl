It looks the same but it is NOT the same. I purchased the previous one at a higher end plumbing/fixture store. This one on amazon is made for mass consumption and is not the same quality. the water flow is not as great as the low of my older showerhead even though I removed the water-saver mechanism in the new one. Its a cheaper product. Ended up using the older showerhead. \n Polarity: positive", "target": "False"}

I would shake it to try to get peppercorns to feed but that never really helped much. Only emptying it, clearing the neck and reloading it would get it working again for a few more turns. Seems like the neck is too narrow and gets clogged inside. I finally tossed it out because even the disposable McCormick pepper grinder works consistently without all the fuss. \n Polarity: negative", "target": "True"}
