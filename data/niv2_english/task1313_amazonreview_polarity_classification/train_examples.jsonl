I do not know what the consistency is supposed to be like but I know I do not like this. It is like pouring water out of a container. There is no thickness to the product and is like the bubble mixture you make for kids to blow bubbles with dish soap. I ordered two scents. Diva smelled fine. High Maintenance smelled like bug spray. I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine. I would spend way too much money on something that smells good and lasts. That brand promise is exciting. I do not know if this is how it is supposed to be or if in fact this is not the real product. I cannot imagine wanting to purchase this product based on this. Maybe someone can tell me if this is how it is supposed to be and if so, how do I have any success with the product?
