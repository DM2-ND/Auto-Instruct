In the first movie, Neo enters Smith's code and basically decompiles him from the inside, which presumably destroys him (though we know enough of him survives to resurface with \"upgrades\" taken from Neo). In the third movie, Smith overwrites Neo's RSI, which, because Neo is hooked into the Matrix directly from the machine city at the time, gives the machine city the opening they need to pump an antivirus into the Matrix and cleanse all of the Smith-infected code. This purges the Smith code from the Matrix completely, but has the side effect of killing Neo.  <sep>  Q: If Neo survived in the first movie, how come he didn't in the third movie? A: It's not the same attack  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What attack was it?", "target": "Yes"}
{"id": "task1442-545b96a719674dd1b6778c3a63ae3fdc", "input": "CONTEXT: I don't know this for sure, but here is my educated guess. In this featurette they're using the word \"hero\" to identify the \"real world\" Nina. There are 2 Nina's in those shots. One is the \"hero\" (main character of the film, whom the audience identifies with and empathizes with) and then there's the evil reflective Nina (in one shot called the \"reflective element\"). There's also the green-screen element. Put all of those together, and you get the final comp (comp = composite shot, which is a shot made up of multiple elements).  <sep>  Q: What is a \"hero plate\"? A: hero\" to identify the \"real world\" Nina  Q: What is the purpose of it in film? A: One is the \"hero\" (main character of the film, whom the audience identifies with and empathizes with) and then there's the evil reflective Nina  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What movie has a hero plate?", "target": "No"}

Bojack is an anthropomorphic character because he is a horse that behaves like a human. End of definition. The factual accuracy of his human/horse features is a different discussion altogether. As you point out, it's not all that consistent. For a comedy cartoon, that's well within the expected range of accuracy: it serves a particular joke in a particular scene.  <sep>  Q: Are the characters in BoJack Horseman really anthropomorphic? A: You're using \"anthropomorphic\" with way too much precision  Q: Why do you say too much precision? A: Bojack is an anthropomorphic character because he is a horse that behaves like a human. End of definition  Q: Why in the world would Bojack say he weighs 1200 pounds? A: it serves a particular joke in a particular scene  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So, is he just being sarcastic because he was asked if he was drunk?", "target": "Yes"}
