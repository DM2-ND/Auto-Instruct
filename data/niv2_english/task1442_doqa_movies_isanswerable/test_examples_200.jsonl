They had no legal right to arrest him, lack of evidence and all. Once he lost the money, both organizations hoped the pressure by the real criminal contacts would force Chiffre to turn evidence over, instead of being killed. Both organizations are playing a long game in this. There was no expected immediate payout in the plan. If they arrest him, they would reveal their hand in the events and blow the operation. Additionally, Leiter was playing this by ear. The only reason the CIA could arrange this was because MI-6 decided it got too expensive and Bond was willing to work with them.

The arrangement of rocks into that shape is a traditional fishing technique called a fishing weir. Quite a few Native American tribes used this kind of fishing technique to catch freshwater fish. The rock formation forces the fish swimming downstream into a small area where they can't easily escape, and can be grabbed by the person fishing. From what I've read, it's actually not likely that a real fisherman would have used a weir in such a shallow stream; in those cases you could typically just grab the fish by hand as they swam in front of you. Nonetheless, it is a valid fishing technique in other cases.  <sep>  Q: Did someone arrange rocks in a U shape?", "target": "Yes"}
