It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose.

In the present study we aimed to determine the factor structure of acute posttraumatic symptoms in two recently traumatized samples. In sample 1, 203 civilian trauma survivors were administered the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) approximately 1 week posttrauma. In sample 2, 182 civilian treatment seeking trauma survivors completed the DTS at an average of 41.4 days posttrauma. Our confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a 4-factor intercorrelated model provided the best representation of the data in both samples. The four factors are best described as reexperiencing, active avoidance, dysphoria, and hyperarousal. For acute posttraumatic symptoms, the empirical data suggest to split the avoidance cluster into 'Active avoidance' and 'Dysphoria'-confirming findings in studies on chronic PTSD. In future revisions of the DSM, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD may need to be adapted to fit the research findings.", "target": "Symptoms of which disorder are evaluated with the Davidson Trauma Scale?"}

The cause of MWS is a de novo mutation in the ZEB2 gene. This report describes a Turkish boy who was clinically diagnosed with MWS and had his diagnosis confirmed by molecular analysis of the ZEB2 gene. The investigation identified a heterozygous complex rearrangement in exon 8 of ZEB2, specifically a 48-nucleotide deletion and a 44-nucleotide insertion that caused a frameshift. MWS is a relatively newly identified disorder, and even MWS patients without Hirschsprung disease can be diagnosed easily based on clinical findings alone.", "target": "Which gene is responsible for the development of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?"}

CML is a clonal disease of stem cell origin and an excellent example of a malignancy in which tumor-initiating cells may hold the key to disease eradication. The known molecular basis of CML has enabled the development of Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate. However, the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as rationally designed first-line therapies, has been tempered by problems of disease persistence and resistance. Residual disease has been shown to be enriched within the stem cell compartment and to persist at stable levels for up to 5 years of complete cytogenetic response. This finding has led to further searches for novel strategies aimed at eliminating these cells; such strategies may be essential in achieving cure. The most significant recent findings are discussed in this review.", "target": "What tyrosine kinase, involved in a Philadelphia- chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, is the target of Imatinib (Gleevec)?"}
