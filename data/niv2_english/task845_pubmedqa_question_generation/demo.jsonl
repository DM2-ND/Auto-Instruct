Especially important extrinsic factor is ultraviolet radiation, which causes premature aging of the skin. Intrinsic aging is influenced by genetic factors, and changes in hormones. In menopause, changes in hormonal balance have been suggested to enhance aging of the skin.\nAnswer: Accordingly, several studies have been accomplished, in which hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used in order to prevent skin aging at or after the menopause. In this overview the results of previous studies, and a study done recently, are critically reviewed.", "target": "Do systemic estrogens have no conclusive beneficial effect on human skin connective tissue?"}

We examined if respiratory function deterioration appears earlier or is more severe in patients with upper-limb onset.', 'We compared the results of various pulmonary function tests (PFT) obtained at diagnosis depending on the site of onset in 49 ALS patients. In a longitudinal study, we compared the deterioration of forced vital capacity (FVC) in relation to the site of onset, and analyzed the time elapsed to reach values below 80% of predicted according to site of onset, and we compared the survival depending on the site of onset.', 'No significant differences in PFT were found in the upper-limb onset group in any of the analysis performed. No differences in survival were detected in any disease onset group.\nAnswer: Pulmonary function deterioration does not appear to be time-linked to arm onset in ALS.", "target": "Is respiratory function deterioration time-linked with upper-limb onset in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?"}

The way industry went about fulfilling this mandate in the Asian region is discussed.
