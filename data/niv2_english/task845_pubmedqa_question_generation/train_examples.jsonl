Muscle biopsies were collected before and after treatment. Alterations in gene expression were evaluated by gene array.

The between-subject variation in skeletal muscle gene expression was greater than that observed in response to prolonged ESA treatment.\nAnswer: Erythropoietin is unlikely to exert direct effects in human skeletal muscle due to a lack of Epo-R protein. Furthermore, prolonged ESA treatment does not seem to exert either direct or indirect effects on skeletal muscle gene expression.", "target": "Does prolonged erythropoietin treatment impact gene expression in human skeletal muscle?"}
