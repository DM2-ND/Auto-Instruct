In tissue where this activity had been reduced by either forskolin or diazoxide, serotonin caused a dose-dependent increase in contractions and produced up to a 3-fold increase in contractions over basal activity.\nAnswer: The ability of serotonin to increase contractions in the uterus appears to depend on the background activity of the tissue and is greatest in quiescent tissue.

Random walks are a well-studied discipline in both Web and Knowledge Base datasets.', 'Our experiments over the TREC Medical Record track show improvements in both the 2011 and 2012 datasets over a strong baseline.\nAnswer: Our analysis shows that the success of our method is due to the automatic expansion of the query with extra terms, even when they are not directly related in the UMLS Metathesaurus.

To further validate this paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that periodic direct current (DC) can enhance wound closure using an in vitro dynamic model of cell migration.', 'Layers of primary fibroblasts were wounded and treated with DC under various voltages. Repair area, cell velocity, and directionality as well as lamellipodium area were evaluated at different times. Direct current had no beneficial effect on cell migration. Moreover, prolonged stimulation under the highest voltage led to significant reduction in wound closure and cell velocity. The reduction of membrane protusions in stimulated cells may be associated with the deleterious effect of DC.\nAnswer: Contrary to the authors' expectations, they found that periodic DC did not promote wound closure, a finding that emphasizes the need to clarify the complex effects of electrical fields on migrating cells.", "target": "Does periodic direct current promote wound closure in an in vitro dynamic model of cell migration?"}
