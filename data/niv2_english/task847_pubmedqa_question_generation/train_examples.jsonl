To identify processes of vascular development or regression, vascular elements must be recognised and quantified in a three-dimensional (3D) arrangement. Vascular corrosion casts enable the creation of 3D replicas of vascular trees. The aim of our study was to identify suitable casting media and optimise the protocol for porcine liver vascular corrosion casting.', 'Mercox II\u00ae (Ladd Research, Williston, Vermont, USA) and Biodur E20\u00ae Plus (Biodur Products, Heidelberg, Germany) were tested in 4 porcine livers. The resins (volume approximately 700 mL) were injected via the portal vein. Corrosion casts were examined by macro-computed tomography, micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy.', 'For hepatectomies, the operating protocol was optimised to avoid gas or blood clot embolisation. We present a protocol for porcine liver vascular bed casting based on corrosion specimens prepared using Biodur E20\u00ae epoxy resin.", "target": "Does porcine liver vascular bed in Biodur E20 corrosion cast?"}

The association between hearing loss and clinical parameters, particularly oestrogen and previous growth hormone (GH) treatment, was investigated.', 'A cross-sectional study of pure tone audiometry tests in an adult TS population. Previous ENT history, karyotype, anthropomorphic measurements and the impact of oestrogen and childhood GH therapy were assessed. One hundred and thirty-eight women (median age 29, range 16-67 years) completed the study.', 'Normal hearing was found in 20.3% of women, CHL in 18.8%, SNHL in 57.2% and confounding factors in 3.6%. Neither CHL nor SNHL were associated with oestrogen deficiency or GH treatment independent of age. CHL but not SNHL was more common in those with a history of recurrent otitis media (p < 0.01) and monosomy 45,X (p < 0.01).", "target": "Are oestrogen deficiency and growth hormone treatment in childhood associated with hearing in adults with turner syndrome?"}

Our objective was to clarify the effect of dietary histidine, in particular, on food intake and/or body fat accumulation in rats.', 'Male Wistar rats were assigned to one of four groups after acclimation and allowed free access to diets containing 20% casein (0% histidine), 20% casein plus 1.0% histidine, 20% casein plus 2.5% histidine, or 20% casein plus 5% histidine for 8 d.', 'Food intake and body weight were recorded daily and compared between groups. During the experimental period, food intake decreased according to the increases in dietary histidine. There was a negative and significant (P < 0.01) correlation between dietary histidine (grams per 8 d) and retroperitoneal fat pad (grams per 100 g of body weight). Uncoupling protein-1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue increased with increases in dietary histidine.", "target": "Does histidine supplementation suppress food intake and fat accumulation in rats?"}

By focusing our analyses sequentially on these various portions, we have obtained clear evidence for concerted evolution of MHC class I molecules, suggesting the occurrence of extensive interallelic and intergenic exchanges. Intra-species homogenisation of sequences is particularly noticeable at the level of exon 4, which codes for the alpha3 domain, but our results suggest that homogenisation also concerns certain residues of the alpha1-alpha2 codomain that lie outside the antigen recognition site.", "target": "Is the orthology of HLA-E and H2-Qa1 hidden by their concerted evolution with other MHC class I molecules?"}

Here we address the question whether an anxiety-like state can associate with taste to produce conditioned taste aversion (CTA).', 'We have used an anxiogenic agent, the 5-HT2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), to induce an anxiety-like emotional state in rats after consumption of an unfamiliar tastant.', 'The anxiogenic agent induced CTA. The mCPP-induced CTA could be prevented by concomitant administration of ethanol, which is known to reverse mCPP-induced anxiety-like behavior, at a concentration that had no effect on CTA memory. In contrast, ethanol did not prevent LiCl-induced CTA.

Either 1 g of amethocaine or placebo was applied for 30 minutes before vaccination. The Modified Behavioral Pain Scale was used to assess pain; the mean (standard deviation) pain scores for the amethocaine group (n = 61) was 1.5 (1.6) versus 2.3 (2.2) for the placebo group (n = 59).
