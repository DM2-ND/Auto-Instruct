After establishing pain control, the athlete continued with a further series of treatments to control symptoms of muscle tightness.", "target": "Do electrical twitch obtaining intramuscular stimulation ( ETOIMS ) for myofascial pain syndrome in a football player?"}

CGRP receptor is composed of receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 combined with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) for CGRP. We investigated the role of CGRP in mice with experimentally induced colitis.', 'We used dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis in mice. We compared the severity of colitis in wild-type (WT) mice, mice treated with a CGRP receptor antagonist (CGRP', 'The severity of inflammation in DSS-induced colitis increased markedly in CGRP", "target": "Does rAMP1 suppress mucosal injury from dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice?"}

We aimed to determine involvement of sleep and characteristics of spindles and slow waves in a motor skill in children.', 'We hypothesized sleep-dependence of skill enhancement and an association of interindividual differences in skill and sleep characteristics.', '30 children (19 females, 10.7 \u00b1 0.8 years of age; mean \u00b1 SD) performed finger sequence tapping tasks in a repeated-measures design spanning 4 days including 1 polysomnography (PSG) night. Initial and delayed performance were assessed over 12 h of wake; 12 h with sleep; and 24 h with wake and sleep. For the 12 h with sleep, children were assigned to one of three conditions: modulation of slow waves and spindles was attempted using acoustic perturbation, and compared to yoked and no-sound control conditions.', 'Mixed effect regression models evaluated the association of sleep, its macrostructure and spindles and slow wave parameters with initial and delayed speed and accuracy.", "target": "Do sleep spindle and slow wave frequency reflect motor skill performance in primary school-age children?"}
