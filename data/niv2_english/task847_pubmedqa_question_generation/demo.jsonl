The precise placement of implants in accordance with greater safety and confidence allow the practitioner to offer a safer, more secure and predictable treatment than could previously be provided. In this report, this novel approach is illustrated through description of 1 difficult case.', 'Using principles of computer-assisted design and rapid manufacturing, the data acquisitioned from computerized tomography was used to plan implant rehabilitation and to transfer this information to the surgery as well.', 'The procedure of implant planning in this sophisticated technique has potential to yield substantial public health benefits.", "target": "Do a novel stereolithographic surgical guide template for planning treatment involving a mandibular dental implant?"}

Pain and emotion assessments were conducted during the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.', 'Women with FM experienced more pain, menstrual symptoms, and negative affect than did women with RA and the controls. All women reported less positive affect during the luteal phase, although this pattern was more pronounced in women with FM and RA than in controls.", "target": "Does menstrual cycle influence on pain and emotion in women with fibromyalgia?"}

Missense and splice site mutations in the TAU gene have been identified in approximately 15% of all frontotemporal dementia cases. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of mutations in the TAU gene in development of frontotemporal dementia phenotype in patients of French or English Canadian origins.', 'Fourteen patients with frontotemporal dementia phenotype and 98 normal controls were recruited for the study. The TAU gene was screened by sequencing and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.', 'No mutations, except some new polymorphisms, were detected in the TAU gene of these patients. One polymorphism, however, may play a role in pathogenesis.", "target": "Are tAU mutations a predominant cause of frontotemporal dementia in Canadian patients?"}
