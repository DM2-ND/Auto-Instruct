Anyway she's ranting about how she hates her job and I'm nodding along and agreeing things must be hard for her, but then she starts ranting about politics. She starts talking about Mueller Report, Trump, then after 5 minutes she's talking about Socialism.\n\nAt this point I just say ''Please stop talking'' and she says ''What??'' so I repeat, ''Please stop talking'' and I turn over to go to sleep. I can feel an air of awkwardness but she stops talking and goes back to sleep.\n\nAnyway I woke up a few hours later and snuck out lol. I told my friends they said I should have ''sucked it up'' and listened to her mind numbing crap and that I'm an asshole for not doing so, AITA?", "target": "AUTHOR"}

However, when I play it in the middle of the day, at any volumes pretty much (except for approaching and at full blast which I don\u2019t do), my only next door neighbors bang on the wall. Right now it\u2019s 4:00 in the afternoon and I am playing at a moderate level.  I also try not to play as it gets close to quiet hours, but again whenever I do play I get some banging on the wall.
