Ex was *extremely* abusive, and left me really mentally scarred, to the point where I have flashback semi-regularly. Fast forward to yesterday, talking to a girl who I\u2019d met online as well and known for a couple weeks, and she says she wants to date me. I don\u2019t really know why, it\u2019s likely because I\u2019m a massive people-pleaser doormat, but I say yes, because I like her as a person and she\u2019s kinda cute. Really soon after, I start having *extreme* flashbacks. This goes on for about twelve hours before I tell her I\u2019m not able to keep on with the relationship. She says okay, but keeps on flirting with me into today, when I tell her that in all honesty, I just need to stop talking to her for a bit so I can sort myself out. AITA?", "target": "NOBODY"}
