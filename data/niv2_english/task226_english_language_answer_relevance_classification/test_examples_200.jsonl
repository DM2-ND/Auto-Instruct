Consider this note on usage from the Oxford Dictionaries: The words egoism and egotism are frequently confused, as though interchangeable, but there are distinctions worth noting. Both words derive from Latin ego ('I'), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term , denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word 'I,' and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct. An egoist, then , might devote considerable attention to introspection, but could be modest about it, whereas an egotist would have an exaggerated sense of the importance of his or her self-analysis, and would have to tell everyone.", "target": "yes"}

Isn't it \"produce an uniform magnetic field\", or is the existing \"produce a uniform magnetic field pattern\" correct? \nAnswer: The word uniform begins with a palatal approximant /j/. The palatal approximant is a consonantal sound, even though the letter itself is a vowel. Since we use the pronunciation of the word following the article to determine whether we use \"a\" or \"an\", and because it is pronounced starting with a consonant, we use \"a\".

However, many people interchange the usage of these words: On the rare occasions we encounter one, we refer to a steam locomotive as an engine, the same word that we give to the motive power of an aircraft.

To describe any job as a \"salt mine\" is a hyperbolic way of saying the work is unpleasant, arduous, or repetitive. edit reading John's reference, I realized I was confusing salt mines with classical tin mines (also very unpleasant).

In most cases where a person may become king, there is only one king in the political structure he inhabits. For instance, if he is in the line of succession for the English throne, he probably cannot become king of France or Denmark without marrying into that royal family.

A registry number, however, is the number given to a place of registration or a book or list of registration, since too many of them may be around, but that number is not large, say, in five digits mostly because there are only a limited number of registration places or books or lists that are in existence for every particular purpose while a registration number involving companies, items, goods or persons may be as large as 16 digits and more and may comprise from letters and digits both, because there a great many numbers of those items or companies or persons who are registered.", "target": "no"}
