Of course, I'm a native English speaker, and I have no idea either, hence this question. The full question, for context, was \"Several of our sister sites have taken to featuring Questions [...]\". It does seem odd, considering that English (usually) uses masculine terms as the default. \nAnswer: It is because only female carries the direct increase/multiplication through reproduction; that's why we also say mother tongue.", "target": "no"}
{"id": "task226-ec3413b9c13a440f80b5a301c46e3300", "input": "Question: The word second can refer to ordinal #2 (that which comes after first), or a unit of time, 1/60 of a minute. Ordinarily you might think that this is just a coincidence, but in Spanish, the word segundo also means both a second (of time) and ordinal #2, which suggests that there's some actual link between the two meanings somewhere. So, why is there a \"second\" of time but not a \"first\"? \nAnswer: The English word minute in the time sense (and the various similar European words) came from Latin 'pars minuta prima' or 'first small part'; when it became necessary to subdivide even further, the obvious term was 'pars minuta secunda' which became second and its various cognates. (Best explained in Etymonline.).", "target": "yes"}
